We're a growing team with a lot of backend knowledge so we're hoping to round the team out by adding someone with a good eye for UI/UX.</p><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING</strong></p><p>Your work will be heavily focused toward high level, high impact areas. You’ll work closely with Product Managers and Designers to plan, design, and implement some of our more complex features while keeping our UI fresh and modern. You’ll have a strong voice in the development and planning processes, so past senior level experience is key.</p><p>We work in weekly sprints and use Pivotal Tracker to keep things organized. While we keep meetings to a minimum, our remote team is heavily collaborative and takes advantage of modern tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and Hangouts to stay in touch.</p><p>Our stack includes Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Postgres and Heroku. We’re currently on Rails 5 and strive to keep our frameworks and libraries up to date.</p><p>This is a position we consider essential to the company’s success. Be sure to mention coffee in your application so we know you actually read this.</p><p><strong>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU</strong></p><ul><li>Be a part of an incredible team of “A” players who go above and beyond to make Fleetio a successful company. We’re a customer-centric team with a great product, excellent support, and countless happy customers.</li><li>Work from our HQ in Birmingham, AL or REMOTELY wherever you’d like as a part of our strong remote working culture.</li><li>Build software used by people all around the world.

Crafting a delightful user experience is hard work, but we welcome the challenge and are looking for team members who share our ambition.</p><p>We’re a startup that’s in “scale up” mode, meaning we’re past the days of just a couple of people in a small office, but we’re still very much a fast-paced, highly collaborative company.</p><p>About 40% of our team works remotely and we’re committed to fostering a tight-knit team through various collaboration tools.

We now need to incrementally build out our own stack and therefore need an experienced, hands on dev to kick start and grow our tech team. </span></p><p><span>You’ll be working directly with the CEO (me) and the growth team to plan and incrementally build out our tech stack. I’ve built out software and data-science teams, am a Rails dev/geek and (I hope) not a dick so we should get along well.</span></p><p><span>We’ll work on delivering value quickly without skipping on important stuff like good test coverage, thoughtfully refactored code and a CI suite. My plan is to quickly grow the tech team as we prove value to the board. You’ll have the opportunity to grow into a management position (although the CTO will probably need to be Sydney based) or just keep your head down cutting code.</span></p><p><strong>Skills</strong></p><ul><li><span>Experience professionally developing software in Rails</span></li><ul><li><span>In a senior role at a startup </span></li><li><span>Working fullstack </span></li></ul><li><span>An understanding and appreciation of</span></li><ul><li><span>User-friendly software</span></li><li><span>Delivering value (customer, business)</span></li></ul><li><span>Experience integrating with other tech: CRMs, ERPs etc</span></li><li><span>A range of front-end technologies</span></li><li><span>The foundations: various DBs, DevOps, TDD, Queuing, REST APIs etc etc</span></li><li><span>The ability to think architecturally: build or SaaS, monolith or services, when to spike vs when to ensure quality</span></li><li><span>Open-source experience and an understanding of growth marketing a plus.</span></li></ul><p><strong>Remote &amp; flexible</strong></p><p><span>We’re based in Sydney but the team’s scattered around Au and NZ so we constantly interact with each other remotely.

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.</p><p>HLT’s rapid growth is directly attributable to their emphasis on attracting top talent and building a culture that is nationally renowned. &nbsp;This includes being on Entrepreneur Magazine’s coveted “Top Company Cultures” list.</p><p><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></p><p>You will be part of the development team building our content management system(CMS) that powers our mobile and web applications. &nbsp;You will get to come to work everyday knowing you are helping educate millions of people all around the world.</p><p><strong>Who We Are Looking For</strong></p><p>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone <strong>bright</strong> with a proven track record in developing software for high <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.</p><p>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:</p><ul><li>You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms</li><li>You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement</li><li>You are a seasoned JavaScript developer and have a solid knowledge of modern JS frameworks.</li></ul><p>Other things that are helpful to know are Vue.js, Postgres, Heroku and Rails.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.</p><p><strong>What We Pay</strong></p><p>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a <em>&quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; </em>stance on vacation and PTO.</p><p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p><p>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:</p><ul><li>Your github username</li><li>A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a web app, node package or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!</li></ul><p>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.</p><p><strong>Life at HLT</strong></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Remote working</li><li>Flexible hours</li><li>Large amounts of autonomy</li><li>Great pay, insurance, benefits</li></ul><p><strong>So Why HLT?</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in</p><ul><li>Coming up with solutions, not just completing tasks</li><li>Being part of a passionate team determined to improve education</li><li>A fast paced and fun work environment</li><li>A career with a higher purpose</li></ul><p>Then we we would love to talk to you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/196220?reset=False&amp;ra=13NYEKqt7OyA&amp;oqs=a%3D13NYEKqt7OyA' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large amounts of autonomy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great pay, insurance, benfits</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

Maybe you already have some ideas about how we could use them more effectively.<br /><br />We’ve also got standalone projects ranging from visualization tools built using React and Rails APIs, to a bespoke pipeline for deploying Go apps to Raspberry Pi touchscreen devices around our venue.<br /><br />*How we work*<br /><br />We aspire to be agile and test-driven - but we’re also pragmatists who try not to get too hung up on textbook definitions. <br /><br />On Monday mornings we review work in flight, pick up new stories, and decide what our focus for the week is going to be. We work on short-lived feature branches, we write unit and integration tests. We merge code as soon as it’s been reviewed and we deploy to production several times a day. On Friday afternoons, we review progress and share ideas for what we could do differently next time.<br /><br />*What’s it like working here?*<br /><br />With four developers and two product owners, we’re still a relatively small development team, but we’re part of a diverse, enthusiastic company of around fifty people (growing to 150 in the next 18 months) hailing from all over the world.<br /><br />You’ll be working at our office in Liverpool Street, London. Our core hours are 9am-6pm, Monday-Friday. We’re fine with occasional remote working, but one of the great advantages of working here at CodeNode is the opportunity to engage directly with our community and participate in our events, so we’d prefer developers to spend most of their working days on site.<br /><br />You will also get unrivalled access to some of the best tech events in the world. CodeNode regularly hosts world-class speakers and experts from across the entire technology spectrum, and we organise hundreds of free community meetups every year.<br /><br />*Why join our team?*<br /><br />●       Allotted significant personal training year budget for learning and development<br /><br />●       Weekly 4-hour continuous learning session about your area of interest.<br /><br />●       Flexible working hours, possible to combine work from office and from home<br /><br />●       22 days annual holiday, increasing by one day per year to a maximum of 27 days per year<br /><br />●       Contributory pension (up to 2.5%)<br /><br />●       Participate in the company private health scheme with subsidised gym membership<br /><br />●       Cycle to work scheme<br /><br />●       Smartphone allowance <br /><br />●       Childcare vouchers<br /><br /> <br />*Who are we?*<br /><br />We are a community of software craftsmen and women, with a passion for tackling complex engineering challenges, and for sharing our skills and experience with others. <br /><br />With 140,000+ passionate, experienced, and highly engaged members, we're one of Europe’s largest software developer communities.Skills Matter organise some of the largest technical conferences in the UK, including FullStack, DroidCon, ScalaX and many more.<br /><br />Every day, hundreds of us get together at our venue CodeNode which is the UK's largest venue designed for technology events. <br /><br />A buzzing hive of activity, CodeNode provides 23,000 sq. ft of community meet-up, conference, training and collaboration space with unrivalled technology capabilities and great transport links in the heart of Tech City and the financial district.<br /><br />At CodeNode, we run hundreds of training courses and meetups every year, and our website hosts over 7,000 hours of videos covering topics from software architecture and distributed systems to diversity and digital product management.<br /><br />*Our process*<br /><br />When it comes to our hiring process, we’re flexible. <br /><br />We collaborate using Slack, email, GitHub, video calls, and screen sharing as well as face-to-face conversations; we can use any of those as part of our hiring process, and we’re happy to do things at a time that suits you to accommodate work commitments or time zone differences.<br /><br />First, contact us, - tell us who you are, what you’ve done, and why you think you’d be a good fit. If you have got a CV, include it.<br /><br />If you’ve got them, include links to your GitHub profile, your open-source project, your blog, maybe even include links to conference or meetup talks that you’ve given.<br /><br />We’ll invite you to pair-program with one of our team for an hour or two, either here at CodeNode or via remote screen sharing. We’ll also want to meet you, introduce you to the team and show you around; we can combine this with a pair-programming session and a technical Q&A, or we can do those online first and then get together afterwards and chat about how it all went.<br /><br />If you’re the right person for us, we’ll do whatever we can to make this the right job for you, so get in touch and let’s chat.<br /><br /><br />*STRICTLY NO AGENCIES*<br /><br />You must be eligible to live and work in the UK to be considered for this role.<br /><br />We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status"

We’re working with ICOs, exploring the identity space, and looking forward to open-sourcing financial technology, which is desperately lacking appropriate and inclusive international standards.</p><p>Fractal’s 6-strong engineering team is known for its sky-high standards and aspirations. Software is hard, and we know it takes curiosity, passion, discipline, and patience to get it right.</p><p><strong>Your Profile</strong></p><p>There's a specific kind of person we're looking for. We understand we’re describing a rare breed, so it’s ok if you don’t meet all these requirements.</p><ul><li>You consider yourself a senior software engineer, and so do all of you peers.</li><li>You understand that “move fast and break things” is only a good philosophy when what you build is inconsequential.</li><li>You're excited to break out of an application's code and think about the system as a whole (tweaking nginx configs, thinking about load balancers, worrying about queues and their throughput).</li><li>You're the person your friends turn to when they hear about that new tech in Hacker News. They do that because you’re up to speed with the current trends and great at breaking down complex technology in a way that your juniors can grasp.</li><li>Someone at our team has done mutation testing by hand because they’re that careful about things. You don’t think this is crazy, and maybe have done the same yourself.</li><li>You get really angry if someone tries to takes away your agile, or your tests, or your continuous delivery, or.... You get the point.</li></ul><p><strong>Our values</strong></p><p>It’s always difficult to accurately write about one’s values in a way that captures their subtlety, but here's a decent start. We can chat more about it during the application process.</p><ul><li>Gather great talent: Have the best peers you could ask for, people you can continuously teach and learn with. We know A-players want to work with other A-players.</li><li>Enforce transparency: Every decision's process is documented in the clear, all information is available to everyone (to the extent of the law).</li><li>Include everyone: Consider all ideas from anyone. Even if it isn't your area of expertise, we encourage you to ask questions and contribute in any way you feel inclined.</li><li>Don't worry about salaries: We want our engineers thinking about code, not money. All engineers get paid enough to live a comfortable lifestyle.</li><li>Promote authenticity: We have an informal environment, and we believe getting along well is fundamental. Everyone's different and we're going to spend a third of our lives together, so we make sure everyone feels welcome.</li></ul><h3>Main requirements</h3><ul><li><p>You've built at least a handful of websites by now, of which at least one really challenged your software design skills and dealt with more than 10 concurrent users</p></li><li><p>DFA, BFS, DFS, A: these are not just words for you. You might not be totally in the know, but you'd know where to start. You can reason about algorithmic complexity and know which trade-offs to make</p></li><li>Your education and years of experience don’t matter but, when we speak, we need to feel like you’ve been doing this forever.</li><li><p>We build our web applications mostly in <strong>Ruby/Rails</strong> for the back-end and <strong>JavaScript/React</strong> for the front-end. We also have a bunch of services running <strong>Go.</strong> Our infra is docker-containerized and sits on <strong>AWS</strong> (Fargate/ECS and RDS PostgreSQL) and is managed through <strong>Terraform</strong>. We work with <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, <strong>Ethereum</strong> (and <strong>Solidity</strong>), and <strong>Lisk</strong>.</p></li></ul><h3>Nice to have</h3><ul><li>Understanding of blockchain technology, distributed systems, and cryptography.</li></ul><h3>Perks</h3><ul><li>Remote work, flexible hours, world-class engineering team</li></ul><p></p>"

You’ll have a strong voice in the development and planning processes, so past senior level experience is key.<br><br>We work in weekly sprints and use Pivotal Tracker to keep things organized. While we keep meetings to a minimum, our remote team is heavily collaborative and takes advantage of modern tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and Hangouts to stay in touch.<br><br>Our stack includes Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Postgres and Heroku. We’re currently on Rails 5 and strive to keep our frameworks and libraries up to date.<br><br>This is a position we consider essential to the company’s success. Be sure to mention coffee in your application so we know you actually read this.<br><br>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU<br><br><br>* Be a part of an incredible team of “A” players who go above and beyond to make Fleetio a successful company.

Crafting a delightful user experience is hard work, but we welcome the challenge and are looking for team members who share our ambition.<br><br>We’re a startup that’s in “scale up” mode, meaning we’re past the days of just a couple of people in a small office, but we’re still very much a fast-paced, highly collaborative company.<br><br>About 40% of our team works remotely and we’re committed to fostering a tight-knit team through various collaboration tools. We place great value on work/life balance and abhor the stereotypical 100 hour/week startup life.

You will enjoy all of the benefits of working in a startup, the freedom to innovate, to explore new technologies and to use your experience and ideas to directly influence the business.<br /><br />*---- Why ClickMechanic ----*<br /><br />ClickMechanic is a marketplace for vehicle repairs. Our platform enables customers to acquire real-time industry-standard quotes for repairs (a first in Europe), services and diagnostics, and quickly book a vetted mechanic online. Our mission is to bring trust and transparency to car repair.<br /><br />Founded in 2012, the company has grown quickly to offer nationwide coverage and is backed by such institutional investors as 500 Startups and Forward Partners, and angel investors including the former CEO of JustEat and Chairman of Treatwell.<br /><br />Vehicle repair is a huge market, ripe for technology disruption. There are millions of consumers, tera- or even peta-bytes of potentially underused data, with an exceptional logistics infrastructure (parts distribution).<br /><br />*---- The Role ----*<br /><br />As a full-stack developer in a small team, you will work across all aspects of the product from architecture and DevOps to code reviews and tech support. Working alongside our CTO & Head of Engineering, you will deliver new features and continually improve our existing code.<br /><br />Technology underpins our entire business. We’ve built an industry-leading quote engine and mobile Mechanic App. We consume millions of rows of third-party automotive data and have implemented machine learning to improve the accuracy of our quotes.<br /><br />*---- Responsibilities ----*<br /><br />* Writing well-tested production code in Ruby and JavaScript.<br />* Refactoring and rearchitecting legacy code where appropriate to ensure you always leave it better than you found it.<br />* Reviewing code fairly and honestly; and receiving code reviews openly on each of your pull requests.<br />* Collaboration with business stakeholders to develop requirements and expectations.<br />* Collaboration with technical stakeholders to discuss constraints and opportunities.<br />* Monitoring our production systems and providing technical support to the business.<br />* Maintaining our development pipeline and toolchain.<br />* Innovation and self-led learning.<br /><br />*---- Our Technology ----*<br /><br />As a startup, we prefer open-source technologies. Our main app is built with Ruby (on Rails) and is hosted on Heroku and AWS. We use both PostgreSQL and SQL Server relational databases and also MongoDB and Elasticsearch NoSQL databases.<br /><br />Our mobile Mechanic App is built on JQuery mobile and we are planning to rearchitect this system onto a more modern framework (e.g. React) soon.<br /><br />Our development pipeline utilises Jira, Git, GitHub, Docker, Webpack, Grunt and CircleCI.<br /><br />*---- Requirements ----*<br /><br />Your potential is much more important to us than a list of characteristics. Nevertheless, here is a list of characteristics that we hope already apply to you, or that you’re very keen to develop:<br />* You consider yourself fairly expert in at least one OO programming language (not necessarily Ruby).<br />* You have built a production web application using an MVC (or equivalent) framework (e.g. Ruby on Rails).<br />* The terms OOP, SOLID and TDD make you feel warm inside.<br />* You can write complicated SQL statements directly in the console without a query designer.<br />* Unix, Linux, Heroku, GitHub and NoSQL are not just made-up words to you.<br />* You can describe JavaScript as a functional, prototypal language and know what that means.<br />* You have strong Git-fu and can perform interactive rebases from the command line.<br />* You’re not afraid to get stuck into DevOps and have a go at, say, implementing Docker in a CI pipeline.<br />* You write your best code when pair-programming with another developer regardless of their experience.<br />* You wouldn't write a line of production code without writing a failing test first, because that’s how it’s done, right?<br />* You read about programming and technology because it’s a passion, not just a profession.<br />* You see legacy code as an exciting opportunity to innovate and make things better.<br /><br />*---- Benefits ----*<br /><br />* Working with leading open-source technologies in an agile team.<br />* A culture that embraces flexibility, and rewards growth and innovation.<br />* The opportunity to directly contribute to the success of the business every day.<br />* A competitive package including company pension and share options.<br />* MacBook Pro as standard.<br />* 10% innovation time.<br />* Manage your own training budget.<br />* Tea, coffee, fruit, snacks and Friday beers provided!<br />* Bringing trust and transparency to an industry which is widely recognised for high levels customer dissatisfaction."
