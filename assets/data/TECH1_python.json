We started out as a software development consulting company way back in 2000, developing performance test and measurement software for customers such as Nasdaq and the European space agency. We wrote both hardcore, low-level networking software and high-level web user interfaces and became quite good at both of those things. We pride ourselves on understanding the lower levels of a networked application while at the same time realizing how incredibly important UX is. In 2009 we took the step and launched loadimpact.com, becoming a product company rather than a consulting company, and we have never looked back.</p><p>Recruiting is ongoing.

We started out as a software development consulting company way back in 2000, developing performance test and measurement software for customers such as Nasdaq and the European space agency. We wrote both hardcore, low-level networking software and high-level web user interfaces and became quite good at both of those things. We pride ourselves on understanding the lower levels of a networked application while at the same time realizing how incredibly important UX is. In 2009 we took the step and launched loadimpact.com, becoming a product company rather than a consulting company, and we have never looked back.</p><p>Recruiting is ongoing.

Do you feel a deep glow of satisfaction when you've come up with an elegant solution to a problem and it just works. In short, do you enjoy really coding? Do you enjoy challenges - do you look for them or even make them up sometimes? Is a good looking UI as important as a clean efficient ORM to you?

We are made of many small teams that are broadly distributed across the US, featuring tightly collaborative groups of developers, designers, and product managers constantly encouraging each other to deliver work that instills pride and fulfillment.</p><p>Our developers are organized into a network of small teams with embedded product managers, designers, and front-end specialists focused on specific functional areas. &nbsp;We believe deeply in automated testing, code review, and iterative improvement. We are in the midst of a transition from a monolithic web application to a microservices ecosystem, and welcome individuals who’ve made that journey before or are interested in starting it with us.</p><p>Our team is located in the United States. We happily support a variety of employees who connect remotely from the American South, the Pacific Northwest, New England, and the Midwest, as well as those who come into our offices in Boston or Sebastopol, CA but we cannot offer full time employment to those who live and operate outside of the United States.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>Our backend engineers are focused on building a diverse family of scalable and robust micro-services, aimed at a variety of educational audiences. &nbsp;Software engineers work in two week sprints, maintaining a balance between building new features and maintaining older ones. New features are designed in collaboration with product managers and other teammates. Engineers exchange code reviews with other team members, provide mentorship to junior engineers, and assist QA and Ops in troubleshooting product issues.</p><p>Our primary backend platform is based on Python and Django and is supported by PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Solr. We also utilize Ruby on Rails in some key applications. Many of our applications and services are dockerized and deployed into Kubernetes clusters by Jenkins. While your focus will be on backend work, sometimes you will be called upon to make changes to our front-end codebase, which is based on Javascript (ES6), React, and Redux.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p>We are interested in people who have experience building and supporting web applications with a diverse and engaged user base. &nbsp;We desire candidates who work comfortably in an agile environment and with collaborators who are distributed across multiple time zones. &nbsp;We value colleagues who are helpful, respectful, humble, and always willing to do what’s best for our users. We desire developers who treat automated tests as essential, and believe that code reviews are a crucial path of learning and of sharing knowledge. The women and men of our platform team have taken many traditional and nontraditional paths to the developer profession, and we welcome diverse teams that are bound together by a mutual love of learning.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>2 years of experience developing web applications and services</li><li>Demonstrated competency with Python and Django</li><li>Experience building and maintaining RESTful APIs</li><li>Experience with automated testing and test-driven development</li><li>Experience with continuous integration tools and a rapid release cycle</li></ul><p><strong>Experience Bonuses</strong></p><ul><li>Django-REST-Framework</li><li>Celery</li><li>React and Redux</li><li>Docker</li><li>Kubernetes</li><li>Microservice architecture</li><li>RabbitMQ or similar messaging system</li><li>Node.js</li><li>Scrum</li><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Go</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://app.jobvite.com/j?cj=o97b8fwj&amp;s=Stack_Overflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About O'Reilly Media</h3>            <div><p><strong>Inspiring the future for more than 40 years</strong></p><p>We share the knowledge and teach the skills people need to change their world.

Why would we work in an office when there are so many ways to collaborate and work together remotely?</p><p>Art+Logic is always seeking creative, bright, passionate programmers who are excited to take on new challenges. Currently, we’re looking for developers with&nbsp;mobile development&nbsp;experience, for possible, upcoming projects.</p><p>Our project teams usually consist of 1-5 developers plus UX/UI design and dedicated QA. Since we create custom software, our projects often involve different technologies and industries, so there is always something to new to learn.

And then I remember: it’s the projects I work on. Nowhere else have I found such a variety of interesting and challenging assignments, and opportunities to grow as a developer. And it’s for a reason. People don’t approach Art+Logic to churn out routine apps; they come because they have something hard, often requiring research and skilled implementation.&nbsp;There is no better place than Art+Logic for software developers to do what they love — and also better hone their craft.</em>”</p><p><br>Job Type: 1099, rates ranging $35-$50/hour<br>Travel: None Required - Work from Home<br>Location: United States and Canada only</p><p><strong>Find out more at:</strong></p><ul><ul><li><a href='http://artandlogic.com/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a<strong>&nbsp;tech blog</strong>, not a &quot;company&quot; blog)</li><li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/artandlogi' rel='nofollow'>www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li><li><a href='https://plus.google.coj/+ArtAndLogic' rel='nofollow'>https://plus.google.com/+ArtAndLogic</a></li><li><a href='http://www.artandlogic.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>http://www.artandlogic.com/careers/</a></li></ul></ul><p><strong>Have more questions?</strong>&nbsp;Email us at <a href='mailto:Recruiting@artandlogic.com' rel='nofollow'>Recruiting@artandlogic.com</a></p><p>Some things are best said multiple times. <strong>Please note&nbsp;your interest in this specific position, when applying.&nbsp;</strong>(You can do so&nbsp;in the &quot;Brag&quot; section.)</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual Conference</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75-$100K (mid-level), $100K-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We contribute to an HRA to offset the cost of health insurance or healthcare expenses.</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights. The full job description for both positions are on our website and includes salary information, videos, and instructions on applying: <a href='https://level12.io/careers/' rel='nofollow'>https://level12.io/careers/</a></p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Character First</strong></p><p>Level 12 is <a href='https://www.level12.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>founded on biblical principles</a> and has biblically informed goals. Accordingly, the reputation of Level 12 and the character of our employees is of utmost importance. You <strong>do not</strong> need to share our leadership's religious convictions, but you will need to share our commitment to the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: honest, trustworthy, reliable, ethical. We have high moral standards and we expect our employees to share those standards. If you use pirated software or media, don’t mind “tweaking” the truth, or think `porn == entertainment`, this is not the job for you!</li><li><strong>Good work ethic</strong>: you work hard and like to work hard. You also work efficiently, seeking to make the best use of your time.</li><li><strong>Dedicated</strong>: you really desire to contribute to and improve our company; you are not just earning a paycheck. You demonstrate a high level of “ownership” for and initiative with projects that are assigned to you.</li><li><strong>Teachable</strong>: you have a willingness and desire for feedback/correction. You are always looking to improve. You are willing to ask for help even if it makes you “look bad.”</li><li><strong>Resourceful</strong>: you know how to solve problems or are at least able to explain that the problem is not solvable with the requirements given. You use all resources at your disposal in an efficient manner to troubleshoot. You know when to ask someone for help and when more effort is needed on your part.</li><li><strong>Technical Prowess</strong>: you just “get” programming, computers, technology.

Streams, Awaaz.De's group voice messaging application, delivers messages through regular phone calls. These voice broadcasts are interactive; group members can send responses (voice or touchtone) that the group owner accesses over the phone or web. Group members can discover and subscribe to any Stream, and forward messages to their own contacts. Awaaz.De offers three other voice-based products: Forums (for many-to-many communication like Q&amp;A), Surveys (data collection), and Xact (personalized voice messaging API). These products have been used across the agriculture, health, education, and microfinance sectors in India by hundreds of social enterprises, foundations, media companies, SMEs, NGOs, government agencies and research groups. Till date, Awaaz.De has served over one million phone calls to over 400,000 unique callers in 13 Indian states and 5 countries.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Pune</span>, <span>Mumbai</span>, <span>Ahmedabad</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>$40K Seed in 2012</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Mobile</span>, <span>Social Media</span>, <span>Q&amp;A</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/awaazde' rel='nofollow'>@awaazde</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://awaaz.de/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://awaaz.de/blog</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://awaaz.de' rel='nofollow'>awaaz.de</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/137/350/137350-201509ce4f4fc5046b89f876e424fa50becfbbbb.JPG?1395430468' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/137/351/137351-dcbc59550cb7bcbfd9fda68cc0794dd2d4a5c5fb.JPG?1395364258' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/182/611/182611-7a259733b55c8f0ceda1dd93fc9a5e7abe6c4ba1.png?1395364259' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Add testimonials, product launches, and photos that highlight your company</div>Add Highlight</div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at Awaaz.De</h3><ul><li><div>Software Engineering Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/awaaz-de/jobs/49219-backend-developer-ahmedabad-mumbai-or-pune' rel='nofollow'>Backend Developer (Ahmedabad, Mumbai, or Pune)</a><div>Ahmedabad, Pune, Mumbai·Full Time<span></span><span>·$10K – $25K · No Equity</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Awaaz.De</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/awaaz-de/jobs/49221-qe-qa-engineer-ahmedabad' rel='nofollow'>QE/QA Engineer (Ahmedabad)</a><div>Ahmedabad·Full Time<span></span><span>·₹400K – ₹750K · No Equity</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Awaaz.De</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Awaaz.De Team</h3><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/neil-patel-1' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/neil-patel-1' rel='nofollow'>Neil Patel</a><span>,</span></div><div>CEO of <a href='https://angel.co/awaaz-de' title=&quot;Awaaz.De&quot; rel='nofollow'><span>@</span><span>Awaaz.De</span></a>.

Streams, Awaaz.De's group voice messaging application, delivers messages through regular phone calls. These voice broadcasts are interactive; group members can send responses (voice or touchtone) that the group owner accesses over the phone or web. Group members can discover and subscribe to any Stream, and forward messages to their own contacts. Awaaz.De offers three other voice-based products: Forums (for many-to-many communication like Q&amp;A), Surveys (data collection), and Xact (personalized voice messaging API). These products have been used across the agriculture, health, education, and microfinance sectors in India by hundreds of social enterprises, foundations, media companies, SMEs, NGOs, government agencies and research groups. Till date, Awaaz.De has served over one million phone calls to over 400,000 unique callers in 13 Indian states and 5 countries.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Ahmedabad</span>, <span>Pune</span>, <span>Mumbai</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>$40K Seed in 2012</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Mobile</span>, <span>Social Media</span>, <span>Q&amp;A</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/awaazde' rel='nofollow'>@awaazde</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://awaaz.de/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://awaaz.de/blog</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://awaaz.de' rel='nofollow'>awaaz.de</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/137/350/137350-201509ce4f4fc5046b89f876e424fa50becfbbbb.JPG?1395430468' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/137/351/137351-dcbc59550cb7bcbfd9fda68cc0794dd2d4a5c5fb.JPG?1395364258' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/182/611/182611-7a259733b55c8f0ceda1dd93fc9a5e7abe6c4ba1.png?1395364259' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Add testimonials, product launches, and photos that highlight your company</div>Add Highlight</div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at Awaaz.De</h3><ul><li><div>Software Engineering Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/awaaz-de/jobs/49220-full-stack-developer-ahmedabad-mumbai-or-pune' rel='nofollow'>Full Stack Developer (Ahmedabad, Mumbai, or Pune)</a><div>Pune, Mumbai, Ahmedabad·Full Time<span></span><span>·$10K – $25K · 0.0% – 10.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Awaaz.De</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/awaaz-de/jobs/49221-qe-qa-engineer-ahmedabad' rel='nofollow'>QE/QA Engineer (Ahmedabad)</a><div>Ahmedabad·Full Time<span></span><span>·₹400K – ₹750K · No Equity</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Awaaz.De</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Awaaz.De Team</h3><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/neil-patel-1' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/neil-patel-1' rel='nofollow'>Neil Patel</a><span>,</span></div><div>CEO of <a href='https://angel.co/awaaz-de' title=&quot;Awaaz.De&quot; rel='nofollow'><span>@</span><span>Awaaz.De</span></a>.

Later that day you use Mozio to book an on-demand sedan, tap onto the London Tube, and make a reservation for a minicab to pick you up the next morning. When you land in Munich, Mozio sends you a push notification for the Lufthansa Airport Bus to the city center, at which point you purchase a ticket on the U-bahn or S-bahn, also through Mozio, to get you to your hotel. 3 days later in Dallas you purchase a DART ticket to take public transit back to your home in Dallas.</p><p>All of those examples of transportation, from shuttles, taxis, limos and even public transit, currently have some form of digital ticketing.</p><p>Mozio is tying it all together.</p><p>Build the transportation app of the future.</p><p>The Perks &amp; Culture:<br>- Yearly 10-day group retreats.<br>- Fun, small, flexible team. You need to work from New York for a week? Feel free. You want to work and travel? Go ahead.<br>- Unlimited Vacation Policy: As long as you get your work done, we don't micromanage your time.<br>- We think it's important to invest in the personal development of our employees, and will be flexible with what you want to learn.<br>- We are all friends: when you are going to spend 50+ hours a week with each other it's important that you don't just tolerate your coworkers but actually like them. Mozio was started by two friends, and we want to bring on other people we can be friends with.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to Mozio</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Mozio</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>Come help us integrate APIs &amp; build out our backend stack.

And each city has it's own transportation stack: you move around SF differently than you move around London, Munich or Oslo.</p><p>Each one of those different transportation options in each city are on completely different technology stacks with different ticket redemption choices. Very often their fare structures are arcane, making you choose between &quot;Tariff AB, BC or ABC.&quot;</p><p>Mozio seeks to plug into all these sources and build your ultimate city mobility solution: we want you to be able to book a Supershuttle in Dallas, the Heathrow Express train in London, the U-Bahn in Germany, and Lyft when you get back home to SF.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Earth</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>11-50

We started out as a software development consulting company way back in 2000, developing performance test and measurement software for customers such as Nasdaq and the European space agency. We wrote both hardcore, low-level networking software and high-level web user interfaces and became quite good at both of those things. We pride ourselves on understanding the lower levels of a networked application while at the same time realizing how incredibly important UX is. In 2009 we took the step and launched loadimpact.com, becoming a product company rather than a consulting company, and we have never looked back.<br><br>Recruiting is ongoing. We will respond to your application immediately.

We are made of many small teams that are broadly distributed across the US, featuring tightly collaborative groups of developers, designers, and product managers constantly encouraging each other to deliver work that instills pride and fulfillment.<br><br>Our developers are organized into a network of small teams with embedded product managers, designers, and front-end specialists focused on specific functional areas. &nbsp;We believe deeply in automated testing, code review, and iterative improvement. We are in the midst of a transition from a monolithic web application to a microservices ecosystem, and welcome individuals who’ve made that journey before or are interested in starting it with us.<br><br>Our team is located in the United States. We happily support a variety of employees who connect remotely from the American South, the Pacific Northwest, New England, and the Midwest, as well as those who come into our offices in Boston or Sebastopol, CA but we cannot offer full time employment to those who live and operate outside of the United States.<br><br>About the Job<br><br>Our backend engineers are focused on building a diverse family of scalable and robust micro-services, aimed at a variety of educational audiences. &nbsp;Software engineers work in two week sprints, maintaining a balance between building new features and maintaining older ones. New features are designed in collaboration with product managers and other teammates. Engineers exchange code reviews with other team members, provide mentorship to junior engineers, and assist QA and Ops in troubleshooting product issues.<br><br>Our primary backend platform is based on Python and Django and is supported by PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Solr. We also utilize Ruby on Rails in some key applications. Many of our applications and services are dockerized and deployed into Kubernetes clusters by Jenkins. While your focus will be on backend work, sometimes you will be called upon to make changes to our front-end codebase, which is based on Javascript (ES6), React, and Redux.<br><br>About You<br><br>We are interested in people who have experience building and supporting web applications with a diverse and engaged user base. &nbsp;We desire candidates who work comfortably in an agile environment and with collaborators who are distributed across multiple time zones. &nbsp;We value colleagues who are helpful, respectful, humble, and always willing to do what’s best for our users. We desire developers who treat automated tests as essential, and believe that code reviews are a crucial path of learning and of sharing knowledge. The women and men of our platform team have taken many traditional and nontraditional paths to the developer profession, and we welcome diverse teams that are bound together by a mutual love of learning.<br><br>Requirements<br><br><br>* 2 years of experience developing web applications and services<br><br>* Demonstrated competency with Python and Django<br><br>* Experience building and maintaining RESTful APIs<br><br>* Experience with automated testing and test-driven development<br><br>* Experience with continuous integration tools and a rapid release cycle<br><br><br><br><br>Experience Bonuses<br><br><br>* Django-REST-Framework<br><br>* Celery<br><br>* React and Redux<br><br>* Docker<br><br>* Kubernetes<br><br>* Microservice architecture<br><br>* RabbitMQ or similar messaging system<br><br>* Node.js<br><br>* Scrum<br><br>* Ruby on Rails<br><br>* Go<br><br><br><p>See more jobs at <span>O'reilly Media</span></p></div></div>"
