We build several platforms for web and mobile, for several organisations ranging from start-ups to well known brands.</p><h4>About the role</h4><p>You might be wanting to step up from a more junior role, or just fancy a change. You might be working in a larger company and… well, be a little bored? Here you won’t be bored; it’s a fast paced and varied environment, where you’ll be trying new technologies and applying them to solve the interesting challenges our clients present.</p><p>You’ll know your craft inside out, but we’ll support your never ending quest to autonomously learn new skills. We like trying new things out in our studio projects. We’re a small company so you’ll have a real say in how we operate. It’s time for you to step up!</p><p>Oh… and we ALL make the tea…</p><h4>Technically ticking the boxes</h4><p><b>You’ll need to be nailing these:</b></p><ul><li>Javascript including ES6 &amp; Node. We use React.js &amp; React Native, and you’ll need to hit the ground running with this. But if your experience is in Angular or VUE.js then that’s good with us – it’s equally valid!</li><li>HTML5 and CSS</li><li>Pre-compilers like SASS, LESS, and bundlers like Grunt, Gulp &amp; Webpack</li><li>GIT</li></ul><p><b>These will massively help your application</b>:</p><ul><li>Working knowledge of other server side &amp; database technologies, such as JAVA (Spring MVC / Spring Boot). We’ve traditionally been a PHP/JAVA/MySQL house – but you can have experience in others.</li><li>Experience in using API based backend services such as Google Firebase, or NoSQL architecture like MongoDB.</li><li>Photoshop/Illustrator/Sketch – we don’t expect you to be an experienced UI designer but you’ll need to appreciate the importance of good design and UI.</li><li>CMS Builds. As a company we offer so much more but we do still do our fair share of WordPress/Contentful builds &amp; similar. A ‘need to know’ around a CMS of your choice is useful.</li></ul><h4>Benefits</h4><p>We understand that different people like different things so we don’t have an official ‘rewards package’… if you want something… ask!</p><p>That said, we offer:<br></p><ul><li>25 days holiday (plus the normal 8 days bank holiday)</li><li>Flexible working hours (we’re a task based organisation)</li></ul><ul></ul><p><b>So - if you think you can step up to the plate and become Spork's new prong, then get in touch! Send through your CVs, portfolios, repository details or whatever you have to jobs@wearespork.net.</b></p>"

Industrialisation has brought to our shelves mass-produced, mass-distributed products and mass-marketed brands.</p><p>Unfortunately for small wine producers, they can only craft by hand a small batch each time and thanks to the three-tier system, distribution happens at very low margins and sometimes even at a loss.</p><p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_system_(alcohol_distribution)' rel='nofollow'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_system_(alcohol_distribution)</a></p><p>Most wineries in the world (circa 80%) are small mum-and-dad businesses. Passionate about crafting a piece of art. Most are not business savvy. Most are not tech savvy. Most struggle with simply emailing those who love their product, and love their story. </p><p>Yet, to survive, they need more people who care about them, to talk about them. Direct sales is key to their survival.</p><p>This total disaster extends to every wine lover. The best wine stories ever encountered can hardly be brought home or shared with those we care most about.</p><p>That's wineries and microbreweries alike.</p><p>---</p><p>At Troly, we are slowly rebalancing the industry. By connecting wineries together, our project builds the volume and leverages our collective power to help each winery into their direct sale journey. Think of it as Fair Trade Wines!</p><p>We do not have fancy swanky offices (many work from home!) We have an intimate interest in ensuring each winery and microbrewery stands the test of time. We work very closely with wineries, on a first name basis, to educate them, and show them the tools they can leverage to make their journey easier. </p><p>It will be written in history that Troly.io changed the industry. Watch this space.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to Troly.io</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Troly.io</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>You can help!</p><p>Troly is always looking for talented individuals. While there are a few boxes to check, we are far most interested by your abilities, your aptitudes and your attitude.</p><p>As a Full-Stack developer, you will be required to </p><p>→ Assist Customer Success teammates with investigations and liaise with customers to figure things out<br>→ Contribute new features as requested by customers and in-line with our strategy<br>→ Make architectural decisions, improve on internal practices and accept nothing less than quality<br>→ Contribute to architectural documentation and sustainable communications<br>→ Have an opinion on reds vs white wines</p><p>Same as any other roles at Troly;</p><p>The appeal of working for &quot;a startup&quot; or in &quot;the industry&quot; just for the sake of it, is unlikely to get you anywhere this time around. We are at a stage where our interest lies in finding founding team members. We will happily expose you to strategy, planning and the entire foundation of the business if and when required.</p><p>The right person is not afraid to shake things up or speak up when needed. They will stand their ground when they know they are right, and learn from it when they are wrong. </p><p>Technical skills are important, but making sure everyone in the team gets along is even more. We work in a distributed environment, so working alone, using technology for discussions and managing your own time are added challenges you will have to deal with.</p><p>Now, we also realise that these kind of people don’t just turn up out of the blue. So we are always on the lookout and are planning to grow based on people, not hire based on growth. In return, you must be committed, and anything measured in months will be considered insufficient.</p><p>Finally; if your only goal in life is to make a difference and genuinely help wineries, you really should get in touch.

Our stack: React, Python/Django, Postgres on AWS. We are looking for&nbsp;<strong>very strong front-end React.js skills</strong>. Your primary focus will be on developing user interface components and implementing them following well-known React.js workflows (such as Flux or Redux). You will ensure that these components and the overall application are robust and easy to maintain. You will coordinate with the rest of the team working on multiple layers of the infrastructure. Therefore, a commitment to collaborative problem solving, sophisticated design, and quality product is important.</p><p>This is a standard software development job, so all the usual duties apply: write code, test code, review code, do tickets, occasional meetings for requirements (we keep it really light), and provide input on new product specifications. The basic job is: develop user-facing features, build reusable components and front-end libraries, translate designs and wireframes into high quality code, repeat. Your familiarity with RESTful APIs and code versioning tools - particularly Git...please see our company name! - will be crucial! Demonstrated ability to optimize components for maximum performance across a vast array of web-capable devices and browsers will also be a necessity in this position.</p><p>We are based in Durango, CO, but you can work anywhere in the U.S. You can work from home, or we will set you up in a co-working space with your own office wherever you want. There's minor travel a couple of times a year here to Durango which is a pretty fun place to&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to go to for work.

It's our humble beginnings (having originally started from a coffee table in an NYU dorm room) and our passion for live events and building things for our fellow crazy, irrational, &quot;stand outside for three hours in the driving snow&quot; fans that sets us apart from other companies. People can say what they want about us but one thing they can't say is that we are disingenuous because we truly believe that we are taking up the proverbial mantel for the unwashed masses who understand the most important part about buying event tickets in the first place is &quot;being there.&quot;  When searching for another person to round out our ever-growing team, we strive to bring on like-minded individuals who are as crazy as we are and more importantly, who exhibit the passion, creativity, and unwavering commitment to the power of ideas; and who believe that one idea can shake up an oligarchic marketplace and make people rethink the status quo. Oh and if that isn't enough, we also go to a ton of concerts, games, and other awesome events. Heck, you might even have a drunken run-in with a certain All-Pro NFL Kick Returner who then offers you free Super Bowl Tickets (inquire within for the full story).</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to SeatSwap</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to SeatSwap</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>The web's premier event ticket trading destination is looking for a pair of passionate and creative interns to work alongside our development team as we gear up for our 1.0/Beta launch. Interns will get hands-on experience, working with a &quot;first of its kind&quot; product and be part of a team dedicated to building awesome things that people want to and enjoy using. </p><p>Specifically, we are looking for someone who has experience working with PHP stacks (PHP myadmin, JavaScript, HTML, CSS), knowledge of and experience with Third-Party API's and RESTFUL programming principles is not a prerequisite but is definitely a plus. Aside from being technically sound, we are looking for someone who is also passionate about building things and who understands and wants to be a part of what we're trying to accomplish here. One thing we can guarantee you is that this will be unlike any other internship out there, in that we throw our interns into the &quot;deep end&quot; of the pool right away as we hit the ground running with projects that are both fun and challenging. We like to consider ourselves an &quot;idea-centric&quot; company so as much as we appreciate talent and ability we place as much (if not more) value on passion and the ability to bring new ideas and perspective to the table. </p><p>This is an exciting time for us and we hope that if you choose to apply you are as excited about the project as we are. Love of sports, music, and live events is not a prerequisite but may be a by-product of this internship. If interested please send along a resume, links to relevant projects (GitHubs, etc), and an email that gives us a sense of you, specifically what you're good at and what you enjoy doing to info at seatswaptickets.com. </p><p>Best of Luck.</p></div></div><div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Not available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to SeatSwap</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/vigilant/jobs/149698-development-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/vigilant/jobs/149698-development-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Development Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/vigilant/jobs/149698-development-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Vigilant</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bottlestonight/jobs/235947-full-stack-ios-web-backend-engineering-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bottlestonight/jobs/235947-full-stack-ios-web-backend-engineering-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Full stack iOS, Web, Backend Eng...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bottlestonight/jobs/235947-full-stack-ios-web-backend-engineering-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>BottlesTonight</a></div><div>San Francisco, New York City, Arizona</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/crane-ai/jobs/323543-web-design-intern-html-css?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/crane-ai/jobs/323543-web-design-intern-html-css?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Web Design Intern (HTML / CSS)</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/crane-ai/jobs/323543-web-design-intern-html-css?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Crane AI</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/vestorly/jobs/114085-software-engineering-internship-class-of-2018-paid-internship?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/vestorly/jobs/114085-software-engineering-internship-class-of-2018-paid-internship?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Software Engineering Internship,...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/vestorly/jobs/114085-software-engineering-internship-class-of-2018-paid-internship?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Vestorly</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/beyondsitter/jobs/204772-vp-of-engineering-cto-at-early-childhood-edtech-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/beyondsitter/jobs/204772-vp-of-engineering-cto-at-early-childhood-edtech-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>VP of Engineering / CTO at Early...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/beyondsitter/jobs/204772-vp-of-engineering-cto-at-early-childhood-edtech-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Dearest</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/seatswap-1/jobs/84917-lead-developer-technical-field-general?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/seatswap-1/jobs/84917-lead-developer-technical-field-general?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Lead Developer/Technical Field G...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/seatswap-1/jobs/84917-lead-developer-technical-field-general?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>SeatSwap</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/act-consulting/jobs/318192-technology-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/act-consulting/jobs/318192-technology-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Technology Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/act-consulting/jobs/318192-technology-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Act First Consulting</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/travsolo/jobs/294670-full-stack-developer-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/travsolo/jobs/294670-full-stack-developer-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Full-Stack Developer Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/travsolo/jobs/294670-full-stack-developer-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>TravSolo</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/remesh/jobs/207490-software-developer-intern-fall-2018?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/remesh/jobs/207490-software-developer-intern-fall-2018?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Software Developer Intern (Fall ...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/remesh/jobs/207490-software-developer-intern-fall-2018?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Remesh</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>What We're Building</h3></div><div><div><p>We connect fans and avid event goers so they can trade or &quot;swap&quot;

Does writing maintainable JS and CSS come natural to you?</i></div><div><br></div><div>Poor execution is an epidemic these days — if you hate buggy user interfaces and lousy implementations as much as we do, and you know how to implement complex user interfaces with clean JS and CSS, then we should probably talk.</div><div><br></div><div>Baymard Institute is a small independent e-commerce UX research organization. Our research is published as design guidelines and benchmark databases on our web platform and public website (i.e. baymard.com) — it is these two “delivery vehicles” for Baymard’s research that you’ll spend 85% of your time working on.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll essentially be responsible for the execution of Baymard’s end-user experience — making our research a pleasure to use for the thousands of web professionals that rely on it, all the way from the independent freelance web designer to the UX Director of a Fortune 500 company.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>-- What You’ll Be Building --</b></div><div><br></div><div>A good example of the type of interfaces you’ll be building (from scratch) in this position would be something like this page (and all its components):&nbsp;</div><div>https://baymard.com/checkout-usability/benchmark/step-type/cart/3176-ikea-step-1</div><div><br></div><div>In particular worth noting here:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>The colored annotation pins overlaid the screenshot, the diagonally drawn lines connecting each pin to a card, and of course the cards placed on both sides of the screenshot — and how these cards position themselves to avoid overlaps, including dynamic repositioning upon opening / closing<br></li><li>The modal overlay with a background page which is lazy-loaded. In other words, the background page content is not present in the HTML markup on page load — instead, it is dynamically fetched after the overlaid page has loaded to provide additional page context without slowing down initial page load.<br></li><li>How all other pages in the overlay navigation “carousel” are pre-fetched (also in the background) so that when the user begins to navigate through the next / previous page examples, they appear instantaneously rather than having to download first.<br></li><li>The overlay invokes URL changes without a page reload, supports native browser back-button behavior, and allows the user to navigate via keyboard controls (next + prev + esc buttons).</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If you’re able to build interfaces like this from scratch, and can do so in a maintainable and extensible fashion such that new functionality can be added over time without everything falling apart, and (perhaps most importantly) that you enjoy such challenges — then you’ll be the perfect candidate.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>-- Qualifications --</b></div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, we’re looking for candidates who know:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>JavaScript</b> – Excellent JS skills are required for this role. You must be able to write advanced features and functionality from scratch, and do so in a maintainable and extensible fashion (as your future self and others will need to build on top of the things you’re building today).<br></li><li><b>CSS</b> – You should be confident writing CSS for complex UIs, comfortable with front-end strategies such as progressive enhancement, and care about how different features impact browser performance.<br></li><li><b>Design</b> – While we’re definitely not looking for a graphic designer, you should be curious about design and how it shapes users’ perceptions, and enjoy thinking through and tweaking the user interfaces you’re building to achieve the best possible end-user experience.<br></li><li>Interest in UX and e-commerce is a bonus, but no experience or skills are necessary in this area as you’ll work with (and have the option to be trained by) the best in the industry.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>We furthermore expect you to be fluent in english, comfortable working remotely via digital platforms and willing to do a few yearly travels for team meetups (expect 2-3 weeks of travel each year).</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>-- About the Job --</b></div><div><br></div><div>At Baymard you’ll be working alongside a team of dedicated usability researchers that conduct cutting-edge e-commerce research used by UX teams at some of the biggest brands in the world (clients include Amazon, Home Depot, Nike, Lenovo, Etsy, etc). Your job will be building out and refining the front-end parts of Baymard’s web platform, the “delivery vehicle” for all of this UX research.</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Work</b> – Your primary responsibility will be executing the end-user experience of Baymard’s web platform (i.e. the “delivery vehicle” for all of our research). In practice, this means you will be taking UX designs and prototypes, and turn them into production-ready front-end features that can be integrated into our back-end application.<br></li><li><b>Team</b> – Most of Baymard’s 10-people team are UX researchers who don’t know any code. In fact, only two other people on the team are familiar with JS and CSS, and they are by no means experts — so you will be the “owner” of our front-end domain. You must therefore enjoy taking the lead in front-end development efforts, and be ready to learn any new skills required to tackle the challenges that inevitably arise as we push the boundaries of browser tech in pursuit of the best possible user experience for our customers.<br></li><li><b>Technology</b> – You’re free to use the latest JS and CSS features since a) legacy browser support isn’t a major concern of ours, b) we apply most UI functionality as progressive enhancements anyways so lack of support doesn’t result in a broken end-user experience, and c) we use Webpacker and Babel to compile and transpile everything. So go ahead and use your favorite ES6, 7, and 8 features.<br></li><li><b>Remote</b> – We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from any location you prefer (which 70-80% of our employees do). If you want to, you’re of course also welcome to work in our Copenhagen-based office (or a mix!).</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Salary: in accordance with qualifications.</div><div>Start date: as soon as possible, at latest before the end of 2018.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>-- How to Apply --</b></div><div><br></div><div>If you’re interested in this position please send the following (listed in order of importance):</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Samples of front-end code and features you’ve implemented, or helped implement (please indicate your level of involvement).<br></li><li>(If applicable) Samples of user interfaces you’ve designed or been involved in designing (please indicate your level of involvement).<br></li><li>Other information you find relevant (life principles, work habits, work experience, interests, CV, ..).</li></ul><div><br></div><div><i>Note: open-source contributions are excellent code samples – simply send along / point us towards whatever “work” you feel best represents your skills.</i></div><div><br></div><div>Send the above to info+mq4w5k@baymard.com</div><div><br></div><div>Deadline is August 31, 2018. All applications and materials are kept strictly confidential.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>-- Key Work Values at Baymard --</b></div><div><br></div><div>The following work values are central to us at Baymard and hopefully gives you an idea of our culture and what working at Baymard is like:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Flat organization</b> – Baymard is a small organization of just ~10 people. This means zero management layers between you and final decision. You’ll have direct access to and impact on decision making.<br></li><li><b>Lots of responsibility</b> – From day 1 (OK, maybe day 2) you will be working on final products or services. We believe the best way to learn is to work an actual products and challenges, supplemented with rich ‘early feedback’.<br></li><li><b>Long-term focus</b> – Decisions are always based on their long term impact. We’re not interested in hunting after the next “quick win” — we want to make a lasting impact on the e-commerce industry and usually adopt a 5-year perspective in our decisions and projects.<br></li><li><b>Remote from the ground up</b> – 70-80% of the team works remotely. We’ve deliberately designed the organization around remote work. That said, we do bring the entire team together for a week once a year somewhere interesting in the world. (Last time we snowmobiled glaciers and hunted craft beers on Iceland.)<br></li><li><b>Team of ‘subject matter’ nerds</b> – Everyone geeks out a bit on their work interests. We love that, and once a week someone from the team does a 15min presentation on their latest obsession — whether it’s quasi-quantum-worlds or the proper usage of hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes.<br></li><li><b>Founders engaged in the product</b> – We believe it is essential that those orchestrating the work of the organization are keenly in tune with all aspects of it. The two founders of Baymard have therefore performed every type of task in the organization themselves (from programming to UX testing), and continue to work directly on the product.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Do your values match those? Then apply for this position at info+mq4w5k@baymard.com</div><div><h3></h3></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Send samples of front-end code and features you’ve implemented or helped implement (please indicate your level of involvement), along with any other information you find relevant to: <a href='mailto:info%2Bmq4w5k@baymard.com' rel='nofollow'>info+mq4w5k@baymard.com</a></p>  </div>"

Elastic is the leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security and analytics use cases. Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. We believe that diversity drives our vibe. We unite Elasticians across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p>We recently joined forces with a new team, Elastic Code Search and we are now looking to bring on board an experienced Software Engineer to join our globally distributed team.</p><p><strong><strong>What</strong>&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Elastic Code Search?</strong></strong></p><p>Elastic Code Search is a IDE-like semantic code search solution built on top of the Elastic Stack. It helps development teams to search, navigate and collaborate on large code bases more efficiently. Known previously as insight.io, the product has been used and loved by tens of thousands of developers and received 5 star review on chrome store. YOU will be a founding member of Elastic Code Search team and a shaper of the Elastic Code Search product.</p><p><strong><strong>About The Role</strong></strong></p><p>The Software Engineer for Program Analysis will lead our effort to build standardized and open sourced language service that provides code intelligence for both static and dynamic languages. This is the core component of Elastic Code Search, powering core features such as jump to definition, find references and semantic aware search. You’ll also help pushing code intelligence to new frontiers such as integration with logging, APM, etc.</p><p><strong><strong>About you</strong></strong></p><ul><li>5+ year of professional software engineering experience</li><li>Previous work or open source experience on projects like IDE, compiler or static analysis software</li><li>Solid knowledge of compiler and static analysis</li><li>A Computer Science degree or comparable experience</li><li>Passionate about developer productivity</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Nice to have</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Experience with TypeScript</li><li>Deep understanding of build system</li><li>Experience with large-scale data store such as Elasticsearch</li><li>Related research experience</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Additional Information</strong></strong></p><p>We're looking to hire team members invested in realizing the goal of making real-time data exploration easy and available to anyone.

Kraken is trusted by hundreds of thousands of traders, institutions, and authorities across the world, from Toyko’s court-appointed trustee to Germany’s BaFin regulated Fidor Bank.

They are at the heart of our company and drive everything we do. We believe in having a laser focus when pursuing our strategic goals and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution.

We value your skills more than how long you’ve worked on an application, or whether or not you have a Computer Science degree. We don’t care how you’ve acquired those skills, or how long it took you—as a Senior Software Engineer, you should be able to demonstrate a high degree of expertise.</p><p><strong>Bonus qualifications<br></strong></p><p>As we’re working with a lot of newer technology, we don’t expect you to be fully-versed with our entire tech stack, but you should have some experience in a few of these technologies, exposure to several, and a willingness to learn new skills as necessary:</p><ul><li>Experience designing, developing, documenting, securing, and/or consuming a GraphQL API using Relay or Apollo</li><li>Experience developing inclusive, accessible applications, including experience with accessibility (a11y), internationalization (i18n), and localization (l10n)</li><li>Using MongoDB at Scale</li><li>Experience developing event-driven applications using software such as Kafka</li><li>Functional programming experience</li><li>Programming in a JVM language such as Clojure, or Scala</li></ul><ul><li>Experience developing commerce or logistics software</li><li>Experience developing and deploying containerized applications using Docker and/or Kubernetes</li><li>Experience developing with Elasticsearch or other search engine technology</li><li>Previous contributions to open source projects</li><li>Experience with Kafka</li><li>Experience using Clojure</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Characteristics</strong></strong></p><p>As a distributed team building open source software, we understand that being a great software engineer is much more than having a deep technical skillset.

Candidates who don’t submit the necessary information will not be considered.<br><br>If we decide to move forward with your application, we’ll schedule a 30-45 minute screening video call via Zoom to learn more about your interests, talk about the role, and determine if Reaction Commerce is a mutual fit</p><p>We’ll then have a series of technical interviews. The first interview will be a technical conversation where we’ll discuss previous experience and work to uncover how your skill set might fill a need at Reaction Commerce.</p><p>Following the technical interview we’ll have one or more interviews focused on collaboratively solving problems with members of the engineering team. These interviews will involve writing code in a remote pair-programming type of scenario.</p><p>Finally, if appropriate based on location, we’ll conduct an onsite interview so that you’ll have the opportunity to meet key stakeholders on the team. If we can’t do this in person, we’ll arrange it as a video call.</p><p>At the offer stage, you will learn more about compensation, equity range, and benefits. While the entire process can take 4-6 weeks total depending on schedule availability, we’re committed to communicating progress frequently so you won’t be left wondering about the status of your application. We look forward to meeting you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/197466?reset=False&amp;ra=14dSWOlaMuDm&amp;oqs=a%3D14dSWOlaMuDm' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>            <h3>About Reaction Commerce</h3>            <div><p>At Reaction Commerce, we believe that the best results comes from shared ideas.

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.</p><p>HLT’s rapid growth is directly attributable to their emphasis on attracting top talent and building a culture that is nationally renowned. &nbsp;This includes being on Entrepreneur Magazine’s coveted “Top Company Cultures” list.</p><p><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></p><p>You will be part of the development team building our content management system(CMS) that powers our mobile and web applications. &nbsp;You will get to come to work everyday knowing you are helping educate millions of people all around the world.</p><p><strong>Who We Are Looking For</strong></p><p>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone <strong>bright</strong> with a proven track record in developing software for high <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.</p><p>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:</p><ul><li>You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms</li><li>You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement</li><li>You are a seasoned JavaScript developer and have a solid knowledge of modern JS frameworks.</li></ul><p>Other things that are helpful to know are Vue.js, Postgres, Heroku and Rails.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.</p><p><strong>What We Pay</strong></p><p>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a <em>&quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; </em>stance on vacation and PTO.</p><p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p><p>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:</p><ul><li>Your github username</li><li>A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a web app, node package or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!</li></ul><p>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.</p><p><strong>Life at HLT</strong></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Remote working</li><li>Flexible hours</li><li>Large amounts of autonomy</li><li>Great pay, insurance, benefits</li></ul><p><strong>So Why HLT?</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in</p><ul><li>Coming up with solutions, not just completing tasks</li><li>Being part of a passionate team determined to improve education</li><li>A fast paced and fun work environment</li><li>A career with a higher purpose</li></ul><p>Then we we would love to talk to you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/196220?reset=False&amp;ra=13NYEKqt7OyA&amp;oqs=a%3D13NYEKqt7OyA' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large amounts of autonomy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great pay, insurance, benfits</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

X-Team is a community of like-minded individuals, carefully chosen to ensure that they can become part of the community of the most motivated people in the world who come together to unleash their potential. What we've created is truly special and not merely a faceless platform. X-Team is where developers go to feel truly at home together while becoming more motivated than they've ever been.<br><strong><br>How long does your vetting/interview process take?</strong></p><p>It varies depending on our immediate needs and how quickly you respond to our questions and requests. On average, it takes 1-3 weeks.</p><p>More importantly though, after a decade of interviewing developers, we've learned how important it is to respect people's time. We will only ever ask for more of your time if we think you are a potentially good fit, rather than waste your time having you jump through unnecessary hoops.</p><p><strong>Will I get a job immediately after applying?</strong></p><p>If your skills, experience, and values align with a current opening we have, your chances of getting hired immediately are high. If we discover you're qualified, but all opportunities have been taken, we'll continue to work with you to help you get a role in X-Team.

We're growing steadily and to meet new demands, we’re developing new products that busy city staffers (and our own business) do and will rely on to make their cities better for their citizens. Candidates must have a passion for getting things done and be highly motivated. Candidates must thrive in an entrepreneurial environment and be eager to learn and contribute to the team setting. Ideally, we are seeking a Central-NJ based candidate.</p><p>This position is for a full-time, Software Engineer, who will work semi-autonomously and as a part of a small, but growing, team to design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain web-based, back-office software which runs our business, as well as significant portions of our customers' as well as on-the-street (usually literally) mobile software.</p><p>Our biggest challenges are, by design, behind the scenes, and experienced by our clients (the cities) and our own mobile workforce. We're not so much worried about achieving &quot;web scale&quot; as we are about making people's jobs and lives easier. And if we can add at least dash of whimsy in there, too, all the better!</p><p>PayLock helps cities with those &quot;necessary evil&quot; parts of city governance. We try to make those things less evil, both for the people doing them and the people having them done to them.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Candidates must have: great communication abilities (after all, we're a&nbsp;service company, and you'll inevitably be talking to customers), great problem solving skills, an insatiable curiosity and ability to learn, and an innate commitment to getting things done—or, more precisely, an innate need to not let things go undone. And a sense of humor doesn't hurt, either.</p><p>For starters, you'll need a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Design. Developers on our team also work on and develop database schemas, so you should have experience (and proficiency) with that as well. Since most of what we're doing is web-based, you've gotta know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and knowing how the Internet works work can't hurt you. If you understand that much, you probably know a lot about many other things and are constantly adding to your repertoire. In fact, you might not even be able to stop yourself. That's a characteristic we really, really dig: fast, eager, creative learners.</p><p>The kinds of things you might find yourself working on are:</p><ol><li>Building and/or extending a RESTful web api for an AngularJS web application</li><li>Designing and building business management tools (to help our business and our clients')--things like dashboards, alerts, and other &quot;knowledge radiators&quot;</li><li>Building and/or rebuilding a data movement pipeline (we do lots of data integrations with our clients and other 3rd parties)</li><li>Mobile apps for our in-the-field and on-the-road workforce</li><li>Tools for us, the developers, to make our own lives easier</li></ol><p>It's also important that you can keep two visions alive: the near-term and the long-term. We find ourselves juggling the needs of the business (often the near-term voice) and the needs of ourselves and the systems and applications we own on the business' behalf. You have to be strong enough to deliver on the near-term objectives while putting in that extra 10% to 20% of effort to accomplish our long-term (i.e. 3-year) objectives. You have to be ok with taking the hard road sometimes, and trust that it'll be worth it (we think it is).</p><p>Repeat after me: Refactoring is my friend. I will leave everything I work on better than I found it.</p><p>As a growing company, there are plenty of opportunities to pitch in, learn, and develop professionally, and help us&nbsp;reach new levels of greatness, and we're looking for folks who like the sound of that. Drop us a line if you're that person.</p><p># years experience required: years of experience!</p><p>WHEN APPLYING, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE INCLUDE A PARAGRAPH OR TWO ABOUT WHAT MAKES YOU TICK OR WHAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT--RESUMES AREN'T ENOUGH TO GO ON.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/16080?reset=False&amp;ra=5olFkXF3SeI&amp;oqs=a%3D5olFkXF3SeI' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About PayLock</h3>            <div><p>We are profitable AND well-funded 10+ year-old &quot;post-startup&quot; company focused on improving the current options available to municipalities, universities, and the parking enforcement community to quickly, easily, and humanely manage their ever-increasing challenges in parking enforcement--like collecting overdue parking tickets and managing limited parking real-estate while reducing costs. We offer them technologies and services which allow them to do their jobs quickly, easily, and much less painfully than ever before. And we are introducing cutting-edge tools, services and technologies that are literally changing the way people think about parking—from City Hall, which is passing legislation to allow it, to the officers on the street, who are enforcing those laws.

You receive approval from the users or collegues and feel hungry for more.</p><p>Within the first months you will be able to elaborate a complete subproject, consisting of new and existing cloud functionalities, <strong>from idea to operational product</strong>. Throughout the process, you communicate efficiently with all stakeholders to ensure that the result meets the demands and goals of the project. You make suggestions to improve working conditions and tools so that everybody can work in a more efficient and enjoyable way.</p><p>On the longer term, you will learn to <strong>manage the entire code base</strong>. You give shape to the building tools&nbsp;and manage large parts of the frontend - and possible also backend - webapps. You can easily respond to the needs and demands of the team.</p><p><strong>Skills and competencies</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Goal-driven</strong> - You are result-driven, focused, realistic and resourceful.</li><li><strong>Responsible</strong> - Most of the time you will work on your own. You have enough self-discipline to always go the extra mile for Pit&amp;Pit. You don't need anybody who directs or motivates you.</li><li><strong>Persistent</strong> - You are motivated and have a heart for Pit&amp;Pit. You are a go-getter. The possibilities in IT are endless: if you can explain it, you can program it. You love challenges.</li><li><strong>Energetic</strong> - You work hard, fast-paced, are vital and always want to go forward.</li><li><strong>Good judgement</strong> - You have your own opinion based on common sense and relevant criteria. You communicate your judgment in a clear manner and are willing to re-evaluate it if necessary.</li><li><strong>Vision</strong> - You are able to think ahead, you are aware of current market trends and new developments.</li><li><strong>Pragmatic</strong> - You do not like to work according to rigorous standard rules because 'that's the way everybody does it'. However, you work very orderly and structured. You dare to think out of the box: &quot;everybody said it wasn't possible, until someone came who did not know that&quot; (which was you).</li><li><strong>Innovative</strong> - Every day new, interesting projects and new opportunities pop up. An interest in new techniques is required in order to maintain the code of Pit&amp;Pit efficient and up to date. New insights and chances energize the whole team.

The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are transparent, reliable and considerate. You are excited about shipping quickly. You are excited about trying out the newest technologies. You are ready to work hard to further our mission.</p><p>Beyond this, our requirements are:</p><ul><li>You have experience leading a team of developers (remote is ideal!)</li><li>You have both front-end <em>and</em> back-end experience</li><li>You have experience with React - unless you have significant Javascript experience with other libraries so that you’ll be able to pick it up quickly</li><li>You have experience creating and iterating on products from end-to-end: we think there are certain things that freelance and agency work doesn’t teach you such as working end-to-end (full feature) on an entire system.</li><li>You live within GMT-5 and GMT+5.5 (from South America/Central US time to India, Pakistan and some of Russia) for us to be awake at the same time.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Our team  </strong></p><p>We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a> with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d <a href='https://cl.ly/3s0O4314002E' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>. Also, meet <a href='https://cl.ly/082v1Q2D0B2a' rel='nofollow'>Brice</a>, another engineer at Aula and former CTO! See an example of <a href='https://cl.ly/130A1h0V230k' rel='nofollow'>one of our remote offices here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. We’ve explained it in more detail in <a href='https://blog.aula.education/bringing-educational-infrastructure-into-the-21st-century-the-stack-be66b1a743c0' rel='nofollow'>this blog post</a>, but here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Microservices backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to develop skills in building both consumer tech interfaces as well core infrastructure back-ends</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a seasoned full-stack developer that can build features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile) and challenge our thinking on architecture. Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Pushing our thinking on core architecture choices</li><li>Be part of leading a high-performing team: inspiring team members, set priorities and own results</li><li>Building backend microservices</li><li>Working directly with Adrian, CPO and designer, to build, maintain and improve slick user interfaces across devices.</li><li>Switching between different apps and devices (web, desktop, iOS, Android).</li><li>Improving and maintaining our distributed architecture.</li></ul><p><strong>Interview process <br></strong>Interview processes&nbsp;don’t need to be scary and stressful for us to be able to pick out those of you that would fit in the best at Aula.</p><p>The first three stages all take place asynchronously in a dedicated Slack channel filled with other curious and smart candidates - it’s turned out to be <a href='https://cl.ly/1P1P2i0k1320' rel='nofollow'>quite a community</a>. You’ll chat with Oliver about your experience and your thoughts on particular topics, build&nbsp;a simple app,&nbsp;and meet the team on video conference. If both parties feel comfortable, we’ll then give you an offer to join us. The whole process takes place over the course of around 10 days, in your own time.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role. Please start your application with the words ‘I breathe semicolons’ to show that you took your time to read all of this </p><p>Look forward to hearing from you,</p><p>The Aula team </p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://aulaeducation.recruitee.com/o/fullstack-javascript-developer-reactnodejs' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Aula</h3>            <div><p>Aula is a communication platform for education. Think ‘Slack for education’: consumer tech on the front-end yet complex infrastructure on the back-end. We’ve built Aula because we believe digital learning infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning. <a href='https://blog.aula.education/bringing-educational-infrastructure-into-the-21st-century-the-stack-be66b1a743c0' rel='nofollow'>Read about our tech stack here.</a></p><p>For students, this means less one-way communication from the teacher, more collaboration with fellow students (using integrations with tools like GitHub and&nbsp;<a href='https://codepen.io/' rel='nofollow'>codepen</a>) and easier access to student services like the welfare team - even if you’re commuting or are away from campus on a placement.

You turn on your monitor and join the hangout for your daily Standup. Call done, you hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. There are some GitHub PRs you need to review, so you head there first. The rest of the morning goes by working on that feature for the weekly client demo tomorrow. Lunchtime arrives so you head to your Yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls (where did the day go) and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone's day you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></strong></p><p>At nearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields. Our role is to help them build solutions and platforms; help them to launch new product ventures and fundamentally change how they operate.</p><p>Join a highly skilled multidisciplinary team; typically consisting of designers, front-end and back-end experts, DevOps engineers, and also members of the client team.

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p><p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</p><p>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p><ul><li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li><li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li><li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li><li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li><li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li><li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li><li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li></ul><p>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p><p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p><p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p><p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Analytics Fire</h3>            <div><p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p><p>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. Diversity drives our vibe. We unite employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong><strong>Kibana</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>the</strong>&nbsp;W<strong>indow</strong> <strong>into</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Elastic</strong> <strong>Stack</strong></strong></p><p>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p><strong><strong>About</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Role</strong></strong></p><p>This is a hands-on role.

We value prior leadership experience, though by no means require anybody to be on a path toward management.</p><p><strong>We're a 100% remote team and wouldn't have it any other way.</strong></p><p>Unlike some remote roles, we don't have any offices, so you'll never be left out of the loop while a group of people in 'HQ' have an impromptu huddle in a conference room and make decisions while you're not there.</p><p>We rely heavily on Slack, Zoom, Google Team Drive, Geekbot asynchronous daily standups, JIRA and a few other cool tools to stay connected and in alignment.</p><p><strong>The interview process.</strong></p><p>We're a small team and move quickly. Step one is a brief&nbsp;chat with our recruiter, then a short (1-hour) coding exercise, two technical interviews (think coding kata), a brief call with our Product lead and a final round chat with our co-founders, Scott and Brian. From there we'll ask for a few references and get an offer out. Total time? Two weeks or less if we can align schedules.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>No commute!

That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75-$100K (mid-level), $100K-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We contribute to an HRA to offset the cost of health insurance or healthcare expenses.</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

The thought of solving a problem in an entirely new programming language, one you have never even heard of before, excites you.</li><li><strong>Technical Diversity</strong>: while we all have our preferences when it comes to programming languages or operating systems, you should be willing to work with anything, in any language, if that’s what it takes to get the job done. If you are easily lead into a “______ rocks, everything else sucks” mentality, this isn’t the job for you.</li><li><strong>Flexible</strong>: we are small, things change.

We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies.

We work closely with Shopify expanding the native functionality with bespoke Rails apps that leverage Shopify’s extensive API, as well as building fully-custom front-end experiences. We are a core Partner of Shopify, with advance access to upcoming APIs and features, and are always looking to push the boundaries of what companies understand Shopify being able to achieve.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Our team is small with steady growth and fully distributed, and working remotely has been part of our DNA since Day 1. This means you will find a great remote working environment focused around making your day-to-day enjoyable and efficient, both through excellent tooling (Slack, Rubymine), and a remote-only culture.</div><div>As part of a remote team, we encourage finding a setup that provides both the work productivity and lifestyle that suits everyone, even if that is something completely different for each person. Without geographic constraints, time and location can be flexible to fit around each team member’s needs.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As our clients are also remote, we occasionally travel to spend time embedded in their offices, and this can also provide time as a team to come together. Outside of these trips, we also organise an annual meetup to bring everyone together for a few days to get away from our desks, bridge the remote-working gap, and plan for the future direction of the company - this year the team came together for a week in Hong Kong, whilst previous years have included California and Miami.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The company has evolved around a few core principles: quality over quantity, under-promise and over-deliver, and taking pride in your work. We take on projects that will present new problems for us to solve, and get excited about elegant solutions to complex challenges.

You’ll be an integral part of our product and engineering teams focused on architecting and developing our client-side programming.</p><p>We’re looking for a strong track record of architecting and building products. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.</p><p>*What You'll Do*<br>* Lead development on the client layer and user experience.<br>* Develop a comprehensive HTML/CSS/JS framework for rendering web applications for multiple devices and themes.<br>* Refine the application building experience that makes it a delight for our customers to use and extend Knack.<br>* Consistently improve the speed, reliability, and performance of the Knack client application.<br>* Evaluate new technologies and help determine opportunities to leverage these.<br>* Work on implementing front-end Knack features.</p><p>How you’ll do this:<br>* Program: ship code every day<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our small engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.</p><p>*About You*<br>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.</p><p>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.</p><p>You’re an outstanding communicator. You can document a problem, and clearly and succinctly outline a solution. You’re not afraid to distill things into plain English for teammates and customers.</p><p>You have experience working in fast-paced environments, prioritizing and balancing multiple projects, and working with cross-functional teams.</p><p>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>You go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact.</p><p>*About Knack*<br>Knack is a no-code platform that makes it easy for anyone to build applications and workflows to do amazing things with their data.</p><p>Knack launched in 2012 and has been growing steadily as we’ve built our team, perfected our product, and nailed our product-market fit. We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>So why are we different?</p><p>We’re bootstrapped: we’ve had to build something our customers actually pay for. This changes how you do things.</p><p>We’re 100% remote: and have been from the beginning. Every decision we’ve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations.</p><p>We’re small: and we like it that way. We’re more than just chat avatars-- we’ve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other.</p><p>We enjoy the journey: we’re in this for the long haul. We’re not chasing an exit or the next round of funding. We’re building something we’re proud of and want to keep improving on.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*<br>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work. It’s not about separation, it’s about optimization.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. You’ll get forced days off for birthdays and knackiversaries.</p><p>Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</p><p>Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.</p><p>HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</p><p>Please note that we are only considering applicants legally eligible to work in the US.</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Javascript, HTML, CSS, Front-End Development, UI/UX Design, Responsive Design, Product Design, Vue.Js</div><div>Compensation</div><div>$85K–$120K<br>1.0%–3.0%</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Not available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Knack</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/goodtimeio/jobs/307066-full-stack-engineer-san-francisco?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/goodtimeio/jobs/307066-full-stack-engineer-san-francisco?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Full Stack Engineer (San Francisco)</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/goodtimeio/jobs/307066-full-stack-engineer-san-francisco?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>GoodTime</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/car-next-door/jobs/333056-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/car-next-door/jobs/333056-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Front-End Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/car-next-door/jobs/333056-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Car Next Door</a></div><div>Sydney, Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/stealth-startup-52/jobs/309987-principal-ui-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/stealth-startup-52/jobs/309987-principal-ui-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Principal UI / Front End Developer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/stealth-startup-52/jobs/309987-principal-ui-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Stealth Startup</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/91908-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/91908-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Software Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/91908-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Forkable</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/stackshare/jobs/186787-front-end-react-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/stackshare/jobs/186787-front-end-react-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Front-End (React) Software Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/stackshare/jobs/186787-front-end-react-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>StackShare</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/collagedotcom/jobs/348934-lead-full-stack-software-engineer-fully-remote?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/collagedotcom/jobs/348934-lead-full-stack-software-engineer-fully-remote?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Lead Full-Stack Software Enginee...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/collagedotcom/jobs/348934-lead-full-stack-software-engineer-fully-remote?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Collage.com</a></div><div>New York City, Washington DC, San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/325636-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/325636-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Front End Developer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/325636-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Gitcoin</a></div><div>Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knock-7/jobs/320477-front-end-engineer-remote-in-us?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knock-7/jobs/320477-front-end-engineer-remote-in-us?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Front End Engineer -

Come up in social search, get curated and republished, and make a visual impact as well.<br>•  Hashtags that are recommended based on current engagement and outcomes, rather than whether they are &quot;trending&quot; (trending = many accounts sending posts with a hashtag; it says nothing about positive outcomes).<br> <br>What you will experience:<br>•  Building both Android and iOS applications with Flutter<br>•  Learn from mentors and peer feedback in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>•  Brainstorm and implement app features<br>•  Build the fully functional app from start to finish<br>•  Exposure to Rest APIs<br>•  We make you part of the process, so you can earn how to bootstrap your own startup, in case you want to do that<br>•  We ship fast - and with over 250,000 registrations, when put your latest feature into production, your work will be seen and become part of the workflow for thousands of business people.<br> <br>* As a self-funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends who have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time. Should you be selected for a first interview, please do ask what our interns go on to do, either as RiteKit salaried staff or after RiteKit. We'll give you ways to research this.</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers.</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Java, Android, Git, Mac OS X, Dart, TDD,

We're self-funded and doing this for 6.5 years. We believe in what we do, and are committed to the team and our value proposition. We give back plenty but are not able to compensate interns financially.</p><p>RiteKit interns share insights on the team, experience, career boosts: <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a></p><p>At our core:<br>&quot;Enhance&quot;: this feature is the gem at the center the RiteBoost automation dashboard and RiteForge, the social publishing SaaS. </p><p>The customer's customized &quot;Enhance&quot; does any/all of the following in one click: <br>• semantically determines topics of a post and auto-hashtags them for current and historical engagement <br>• Auto-emojify<br>• converts URLs in social posts to a custom tiny URL with a baked-in advertisement<br>• if the words in your post are not good as hashtags, Enhance adds up to two at the end of the post<br>• extracts a good image from images embedded in the body of a page, if the page's URL is in your post<br>• optional: highlight text or add &quot;quotes&quot; around text before Enhancing - this makes an image from the text, with a customer-branded image background.<br>• author attribution<br>• even more options are available</p><p>We serve enterprise customers, too: <a href='https://ritekit.com/api-demo' rel='nofollow'>https://ritekit.com/api-demo</a></p><p>We're growing fast, gaining traction, we're going big, and all the while, our culture continues to improve. No one works &quot;for&quot; RiteKit; we listen, mentor, involve people in the decision making. We work &quot;with&quot; people not above them. Please feel welcome to ask any of us to explain what the difference means to to them. See Hashtag Academy in Medium to see their interviews and read what they say about our impact on careers.</p><p>What do our interns do after us? Search RiteTag in LinkedIn, then do an advanced  search to see the people. Our interns either join the team or have moved on to PopSugar, Google, Snapchat and so on.</p><p>Our four SaaS products in 60 seconds: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to RiteKit</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to RiteKit</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>All RiteKit internships are UNPAID. If you are not considering internships without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you.</p><p>&quot;Hashtags! Yay!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No!!!&quot; That's not what we're about.</p><p>We began with total social media optimization: images, link ads and yes, machine learning powered auto-hashtagging, too. We build and market data-driven social media engagement SaaS products. Long-term: automating needless nuisance tasks out of business people's workflows. (See our APIs for examples.)</p><p>For those who need to get sales, sign-ups, or other specific goals met from what they share to Facebook, Twitter and beyond, RiteForge automates image creation and extraction, adds a call-to-action (something like an &quot;advert,&quot; you might say) to pages shared socially, and uses text analysis and machine learning to aid with hashtags as well.<br>Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>You would work remotely with the lead programmer and CTO. We have our engineering office in Prague, Czech Republic as well as distributed staff working from home/school in many countries.</p><p>FIRM REQUIREMENTS:<br>•  Must write clean, re-usable code (We will test you.)<br>•  Must be willing to commit to a minimum of 3 months X 20 hours/week. (There is no need or preferential treatment for those who agree to commit to longer than three months. Some decide to do so late in their internship.)<br>•  Understand that the internship is UNPAID. No salary, no stipend, etc. <br>•  64-bit computer with at least 8GB of system RAM<br>•  Python Django REST framework experience required<br>•  Fluency with javascript, vue.js, mysql, jquery, node.js preferred <br>•  Must be a self-starter with demonstrated interest (test the RiteForge browser extension before applying, please) in what we have done over the last 6.5 years and interest in being part of what we're building for improving the effectiveness of various aspects of a social media post (hashtag length, position, no. of hashtags, languages, sentiment, update length, mentions, link attributes, etc.).</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this). First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers. </p><p>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN if you excel at your first tasks when you work with us: <br>Conceiving and building data-backed recommendation functions, some using machine learning as well. <br>Doing backflips with social network APIs. <br>Learning to lead: if you are fast and good we will ask you to help others first, move into a leadership position very soon.

Using Fulfil.IO retailers can fulfill orders faster with a higher accuracy, which increases customer satisfaction and improves the bottom line.</p><p>Why? because e-commerce customers are an impatient lot. They want what they bought and they want it now. For these shoppers used to amazon prime and google express, fulfillment speed and accuracy are crucial to this customer experience. But in SMBs, fulfillment operations are antiquated and manual. </p><p>With Fulfil.IO, retailers never run out of inventory, can sell the same inventory across offline and online channels and ship

We work closely with Shopify expanding the native functionality with bespoke Rails apps that leverage Shopify’s extensive API, as well as building fully-custom front-end experiences. We are a core Partner of Shopify, with advance access to upcoming APIs and features, and are always looking to push the boundaries of what companies understand Shopify being able to achieve.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Our team is small with steady growth and fully distributed, and working remotely has been part of our DNA since Day 1. This means you will find a great remote working environment focused around making your day-to-day enjoyable and efficient, both through excellent tooling (Slack, Rubymine), and a remote-only culture.</div><div>As part of a remote team, we encourage finding a setup that provides both the work productivity and lifestyle that suits everyone, even if that is something completely different for each person. Without geographic constraints, time and location can be flexible to fit around each team member’s needs.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As our clients are also remote, we occasionally travel to spend time embedded in their offices, and this can also provide time as a team to come together. Outside of these trips, we also organise an annual meetup to bring everyone together for a few days to get away from our desks, bridge the remote-working gap, and plan for the future direction of the company - this year the team came together for a week in Hong Kong, whilst previous years have included California and Miami.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The company has evolved around a few core principles: quality over quantity, under-promise and over-deliver, and taking pride in your work. We take on projects that will present new problems for us to solve, and get excited about elegant solutions to complex challenges. Most importantly, we want to invest in our team - we encourage continuous learning and development and aim for a high degree of code-review as part of the day-to-day experience.</div><div><br></div><div><b>About you</b><br></div><div></div><div>We are seeking a junior front-end developer with a keen eye for UI and UX design to help us grow our team. You will be exposed to a variety of different web apps and e-commerce front-end builds (predominantly on the Shopify platform), and given ownership of some upcoming projects currently in the planning stage.</div><div><br></div><div>An ideal candidate will be highly self-motivated, able to take initiative in solving problems, and someone that can take ownership of projects, without needing to be micromanaged.</div><div>You will need to be comfortable translating wireframes into a highly intuitive interface, whilst being able to suggest and implement UX improvements in an agile way as you build and receive feedback from the team and stakeholders. Working as part of a remote team has many great advantages, however you will be expected to be able to communicate clearly with the team over a variety of different mediums (including daily video calls, demoing wireframes via Invision, etc), take a task through to completion, and be comfortable with raising issues or questions along the way.</div><div><br></div><div>As a remote team across time zones, we have a flexible approach to work schedule, however we would usually expect you to cross at least 5 hours of 8am - 6pm Monday to Friday GMT+0 during your first year of working with us.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We favour a CS background over any specific language or technology skills, but as part of this we would expect a foundational understanding in HTML, Javascript, Scss / Sass, the modern web and Git.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Required knowledge and experience</b></div><ul><li>Familiarity with Javascript, writing semantic markup and using a preprocessor such as Sass, as well as proficiency with Git<br></li><li>Some experience working with Grunt / Gulp workflows<br></li><li>Strong verbal and written communication in English<br></li><li>Exceedingly detail-oriented – for you, a UI build is not complete until it looks pixel perfect<br></li><li>Deliver readable, well-documented and efficient code<br></li><li>Naturally organized and self-directed</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>Desirable knowledge and experience</b></div><ul><li>Experience with the Shopify platform<br></li><li>Experience with writing in ES6 syntax and using Webpack<br></li><li>Contributions to open-source projects<br></li><li>Some experience with Ruby on Rails and / or React<br></li></ul><div><pre></pre></div><div><br></div><div><b>Salaries and Perks</b></div><ul><li>You can work from anywhere that enables you to have 5 working hours fall within a UK working day (8am-6pm)<br></li><li>Starting salary £25k - £32k<br></li><li>Flexible workspace allowance<br></li><li>Professional Development allowance<br></li><li>Team retreats in a different global location each year - suggestions open for 2019!<br></li><li>A brand new laptop — developers usually use Macbook Pros, or Dell XPS 13s (feel free to ask for what allows you to do your job best)<br></li><li>30 days holiday</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Pixelcabin is committed to building a culturally diverse company, and we value a broad set of opinions in our team.

We can summarize what LivestockCity is by the slogan, &quot;Connect. Manage. Sell.&quot;  Farmers can connect with other farmers locally and worldwide and build their farming network.  The potential outcome to these types of collaborations are unlimited and exciting to us.  Secondly, farmers can easily manage their animal records and expenses/income through our SaaS-based management software.  This software will be a continual improvement process and will develop according to farmers' needs. Thirdly, we provide a variety of ways to buy/sell animals, food products, and farm related products such as hay, farm equipment, farm vehicles, real estate, etc. In addition to these services, we also allow animal transporters to use the site and offer transportation services.   All of this integrated on one site - an online &quot;city&quot; of farmers from around the world.

You’ll be an integral part of our engineering team focused on building and scaling a world-class product.</p><p>We do things a little differently here at Knack, and that’s just how we like it:</p><p>* Flat: we don’t have project managers or dictates from a CTO. Each engineer is lead on multiple projects and is expected to make major decisions.<br>* Autonomous: our engineers own their projects, collectively determine technical implementation, and have the freedom to define how they can maximize their impact.<br>* Engaged: our engineers think of their job as more than just 1s and 0s. Only by engaging with our product, our customers, and our team can they be fully equipped to do their best work.<br>* Remote: to make this work our engineers are great communicators and are highly involved with hangouts/chat/discussions around both engineering topics and larger company issues.</p><p>This isn’t for everyone, but for the right fit this will be the definitive experience of your career. Our goal will be to ensure you are driven and supported to continuously grow and do your best work.</p><p>This is a senior position, so we’re looking for a strong track record of shipping code and building products at scale. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.</p><p>About the Job</p><p>Our senior engineers are ultimately responsible for delivering an outstanding product. This includes:<br>* Implementing and architecting new features.<br>* Optimizing our systems for performance, including speed, reliability, redundancy, and geographic distribution.<br>* Fixing bugs and issues.<br>* Working with our success team to address customer issues and concerns.<br>* Building tools and processes to improve our operations and help us detect and respond to issues.</p><p>How you’ll do this:</p><p>* Program: ship code every day<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our current engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.</p><p>*Our stack*</p><p>AWS - we’ve drunk the kool-aid and use AWS across the board.<br>Node.js - APIs<br>MongoDB, Redis, MariaDB - data persistence<br>Vue.js, Backbone - our front-end is largely raw JavaScript/jQuery/Backbone, currently migrating to Vue.js.<br>Github, Jenkins, Webpack - deployment<br>Ghost Inspector, Sentry, LogRocket - testing</p><p>*About You*</p><p>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.</p><p>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.</p><p>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>You go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact.</p><p>*About Knack*</p><p>Knack is a no-code platform that makes it easy for anyone to build applications and workflows to do amazing things with their data.</p><p>Knack launched in 2012 and has been growing steadily as we’ve built our team, perfected our product, and nailed our product-market fit. We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*</p><p>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. </p><p>Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</p><p>Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.</p><p>HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Javascript, SQL, Big Data, MongoDB, Node.js, MariaDB,

It's the central hub that makes it easy to do something useful with all of your data.</p><p>Knack starts with storing your data in a simple online database. You can then build simple web apps using search, forms, tables, and more to display, update, and share that data. These apps make it easy to manage and analyze the data, build workflows, share it with other users, and integrate it with other services.</p><p>Apps can be published to any site and adapt to the surrounding design.  Multiple versions can be published to different sites and for different audiences. </p><p>Developers can extend these apps with a RESTful API, custom CSS, and JS event handlers.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>United States</span>, <span>Remote</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>11-50 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>SaaS</span>, <span>Databases</span>, <span>Application Platforms</span>, <span>Cloud Data Services</span></div><div><div></div><a href='http://www.twitter.com/knackhq' rel='nofollow'>@knackhq</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://www.knack.com/blog/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.knack.com/blog/</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://www.knack.com' rel='nofollow'>knack.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at Knack</h3><ul><li><div>Software Engineering Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/72947-frontend-vue-js-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Frontend Vue.js Engineer</a><div>Earth, United States·Full Time<span></span><span>·$85K – $120K · 1.0% – 3.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Knack</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/147889-devops-engineer' rel='nofollow'>DevOps Engineer</a><div>Remote, United States·Full Time<span></span><span>·$85K – $120K · 0.5% – 1.5%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Knack</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Marketing Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/63239-marketing-growth-hacker' rel='nofollow'>Marketing/Growth Hacker</a><div>Earth, United States·Full Time<span></span><span>·$85K – $110K · 0.5% – 2.5%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Knack</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Sales Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/314663-outbound-sales-lead' rel='nofollow'>Outbound Sales Lead</a><div>Remote·Full Time<span></span><span>·$70K – $120K · 0.5% – 2.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Knack</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Knack Team</h3><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bigboxofbrandon' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bigboxofbrandon' rel='nofollow'>Brandon Griggs</a><span>,</span></div><div>Founder <a href='https://angel.co/knack' title=&quot;Knack&quot; rel='nofollow'><span>@</span><span>Knack</span></a>.

It will be a challenge to scale while keeping search response times low.<br></li><li>We're doing interesting work with data science: we integrate with Google Analytics, AdWords, Facebook Ad data, and other data sources to measure impact of physical advertising on online behavior. ROI data from prior campaigns can help create more effective future campaigns. As our data warehouse grows, crunching this data will be increasingly challenging and more powerful. We're using machine learning to create better campaigns over time.<br></li><li>We scraped Instagram and used image recognition to see if people shared photos of billboards.

Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads.

We believe that diversity drives our vibe. We unite Elasticians across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.<br><br>Engineering Philosophy<br><br>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort.

There’s lots of research which suggests people often don’t apply because of so-called “requirements” in a job description. If you’re an experienced engineer, like the sound of working here and see something you’re not an expert in yet, that’s great, apply and you can learn it here!<br><br>What you’re getting yourself in for<br><br>Our mission is to build the worlds best part time job. We spend our time thinking about how to give a global workforce complete control of their own work life while completely automating the hundreds of thousands of man hours which would normally be required to manage people on this scale.<br><br>We do this through React Native based iOS and Android applications, React based web applications, a mixture of Ruby/ Rails and Phoenix/ Elixir on the backend and Rest API’s to communicate with machine learning services from our data science team.<br><br>Businesses ranging from the largest high-street retailers to five star hotels and and independent coffee boutiques rely on Catapult as their casual workforce. If you’ve spent time in London, you’ve probably been served by a Catapult waiter or sales assistant without even realising it!<br><br>Our company values https://writing.joincatapult.com/our-values/ are really important to us and influence every facet of how we work together.<br><br>Things we’ve been working on recently<br><br>No two days are ever the same in a startup, but to give you a flavour of what we’ve been up to recently:<br><br>Building a stand-alone signup service to test different approaches to user on-boarding. We took this as an opportunity to test out Phoenix + GraphQL. We were so impressed with the productivity boost we’re also now incorporating GraphQL into our primary Rails application<br>Using Kubernetes to deploy standalone environments for our feature branches, complete with anonymised production data<br>Re-thinking how we test Javascript and what the line should be between unit tests and acceptance tests<br>About the role<br><br>We’ve been growing rapidly over the last three years and as we start our international roll out, we’re looking for ambitious engineers to help us build the future of work. Our engineering principles https://writing.joincatapult.com/engineering-principles/ give a good feel for how we work together and what we value.<br><br>You’ll be working joining out remote team so working from anywhere in Europe is fine! We work in small cross-functional pods of developers who focus on a particular product area and encourage people to rotate across teams.<br><br>**REQUIREMENTS**<br><br>We've found that the best developers are outliers so these are guidelines rather than firm requirements. If you're passionate about building great software, finding the best tools for the job and learning new skills, we'd like to hear from you!<br><br>About You<br><br>* Solid experience developing web or mobile applications commercially<br>* You really buy into the importance of getting things into the hands of a user quickly and then iterating<br>* You actively think about when to incur technical debt and when to pay it back<br>* You like to explore new technologies and have a keen eye for when something new can add real business value<br>* Bonus points for Rails, React, Phoenix or GraphQL<br><br>**BENEFITS**<br><br>As well as being a part of a well funded startup at one of the most exciting phases of it’s growth, you’ll get:<br><br>* Competitive salary + stock options<br>* A strong approach to professional development and mentorship, everyone has a dedicated L&amp;D budget for books, training, conferences and the like<br>* Product retreats at least every two months where the whole team either comes to London or goes somewhere warm (the next one's in Lisbon!), looks back on how we can improve and then spends a week together hacking on new ideas and exploring new technologies<br>* Regular social events &amp; the opportunity to travel to our other offices<br>* Company Macbook Pro which you’re free to take home<br>* A flexible work environment focused on output not hours<br>* 25 days holiday + bank holidays<br><p>See more jobs at <span>Catapult</span></p></div></div>"

Streams, Awaaz.De's group voice messaging application, delivers messages through regular phone calls. These voice broadcasts are interactive; group members can send responses (voice or touchtone) that the group owner accesses over the phone or web. Group members can discover and subscribe to any Stream, and forward messages to their own contacts. Awaaz.De offers three other voice-based products: Forums (for many-to-many communication like Q&amp;A), Surveys (data collection), and Xact (personalized voice messaging API). These products have been used across the agriculture, health, education, and microfinance sectors in India by hundreds of social enterprises, foundations, media companies, SMEs, NGOs, government agencies and research groups. Till date, Awaaz.De has served over one million phone calls to over 400,000 unique callers in 13 Indian states and 5 countries.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Pune</span>, <span>Mumbai</span>, <span>Ahmedabad</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>11-50 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>$40K Seed in 2012</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Mobile</span>, <span>Social Media</span>, <span>Q&amp;A</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/awaazde' rel='nofollow'>@awaazde</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://awaaz.de/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://awaaz.de/blog</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://awaaz.de' rel='nofollow'>awaaz.de</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/137/350/137350-201509ce4f4fc5046b89f876e424fa50becfbbbb.JPG?1395430468' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/137/351/137351-dcbc59550cb7bcbfd9fda68cc0794dd2d4a5c5fb.JPG?1395364258' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/182/611/182611-7a259733b55c8f0ceda1dd93fc9a5e7abe6c4ba1.png?1395364259' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Add testimonials, product launches, and photos that highlight your company</div>Add Highlight</div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at Awaaz.De</h3><ul><li><div>Software Engineering Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/awaaz-de/jobs/49219-backend-developer-ahmedabad-mumbai-or-pune' rel='nofollow'>Backend Developer (Ahmedabad, Mumbai, or Pune)</a><div>Ahmedabad, Pune, Mumbai·Full Time<span></span><span>·$10K – $25K · No Equity</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Awaaz.De</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/awaaz-de/jobs/49221-qe-qa-engineer-ahmedabad' rel='nofollow'>QE/QA Engineer (Ahmedabad)</a><div>Ahmedabad·Full Time<span></span><span>·₹400K – ₹750K · No Equity</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Awaaz.De</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Awaaz.De Team</h3><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/neil-patel-1' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/neil-patel-1' rel='nofollow'>Neil Patel</a><span>,</span></div><div>CEO of <a href='https://angel.co/awaaz-de' title=&quot;Awaaz.De&quot; rel='nofollow'><span>@</span><span>Awaaz.De</span></a>.

We are currently building foundational tools for emerging business models in the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 2.0 space. These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.</p><p>ConsenSys is presently comprised of a number of core personnel — some of whom are based in New York City, but several are in other cities around the world — who are focussed on the identification, acquisition, and development of talent and projects, in addition to the development of our own internal projects and some focus on consulting work.</p><p>ConsenSys spawns, coordinates, incubates and accelerates single purpose vehicles (SPVs) through internal development, acquisitions, investments, or the formation of joint ventures.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Brooklyn</span>, Remote

We are currently building foundational tools for emerging business models in the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 2.0 space. These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.</p><p>ConsenSys is presently comprised of a number of core personnel — some of whom are based in New York City, but several are in other cities around the world — who are focussed on the identification, acquisition, and development of talent and projects, in addition to the development of our own internal projects and some focus on consulting work.</p><p>ConsenSys spawns, coordinates, incubates and accelerates single purpose vehicles (SPVs) through internal development, acquisitions, investments, or the formation of joint ventures.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Remote</span>, <span>Brooklyn</span>, Remote

We are currently building foundational tools for emerging business models in the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 2.0 space. These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.</p><p>ConsenSys is presently comprised of a number of core personnel — some of whom are based in New York City, but several are in other cities around the world — who are focussed on the identification, acquisition, and development of talent and projects, in addition to the development of our own internal projects and some focus on consulting work.</p><p>ConsenSys spawns, coordinates, incubates and accelerates single purpose vehicles (SPVs) through internal development, acquisitions, investments, or the formation of joint ventures.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Brooklyn</span>, <span>San Francisco</span>, Remote

Theres lots of research which suggests people often dont apply because of so-called requirements in a job description. If youre an experienced engineer, like the sound of working here and see something youre not an expert in yet, thats great, apply and you can learn it here!<br>What youre getting yourself in for<br>Our mission is to build the worlds best part time job. We spend our time thinking about how to give a global workforce complete control of their own work life while completely automating the hundreds of thousands of man hours which would normally be required to manage people on this scale.<br>We do this through React Native based iOS and Android applications, React based web applications, a mixture of Ruby/ Rails and Phoenix/ Elixir on the backend and Rest APIs to communicate with machine learning services from our data science team. <br>Businesses ranging from the largest high-street retailers to five star hotels and and independent coffee boutiques rely on Catapult as their casual workforce. If youve spent time in London, youve probably been served by a Catapult waiter or sales assistant without even realising it!<br>Our company values https://writing.joincatapult.com/our-values/ are really important to us and influence every facet of how we work together.<br>Things weve been working on recently<br> <br>No two days are ever the same in a startup, but to give you a flavour of what weve been up to recently: <br> * Building a stand-alone signup service to test different approaches to user on-boarding. We took this as an opportunity to test out Phoenix + GraphQL.

Your work will empower over 8,000 businesses around the world to provide great customer service, and will support other senior engineers on your team.</div><div><h3>Tools we use:</h3></div><ul><li>PHP 7.x</li><li>Lumen, Laravel, Symfony Console, and a custom PHP framework</li><li>Modular and functional CSS with&nbsp;<a href='https://developer.helpscout.com/seed/' rel='nofollow'>Help Scout Seed</a></li><li>React, Redux, Backbone.js, Marionette.js</li><li>Webpack, Babel, and ES6</li><li>Component-based design systems with&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/helpscout/blue' rel='nofollow'>Help Scout Blue</a></li><li>RabbitMQ</li><li>Redis</li><li>Pusher</li><li>Java(APIs)</li><li>MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB</li></ul><div><h3>About the role</h3></div><ul><li>The engineering team currently has thirty-seven talented engineers. On a typical day you may help a customer with an issue, work on a new feature, create a third party integration or enhance back-end tools. On any given project, you will be communicating with internal APIs, integrating with 3rd party services, optimizing processes using Redis, RabbitMQ and various AWS services, and wrapping it all up in support of a Backbone/Marionette or React front end.</li><li>Our engineering teams work in two-week iterations, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/agile-remote-teams/' rel='nofollow'>remote, agile development</a>. When you are ready, you’ll create and send a pull request with test cases and tag your team for review(often over a video and screen-sharing session).</li><li>We have invested heavily in local Docker development and cloud-based continuous integration and delivery so you can get setup fast and your development branch can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.</li><li>Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our top-notch in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.</li><li>Everything is secondary to the&nbsp;<i>customer experience</i>. We expect you to have a keen sense of how your code will impact the experience in terms of performance, security and usability.</li><li>You'll be working with product people that challenge you to get better every day. The founders are technical and committed to creating a magical experience for customers. You'll deploy work that moves the needle for businesses around the world.</li></ul><div><h3>About you</h3></div><ul><li>You are very experienced with modern PHP development practices and open source frameworks. You’ve worked on these sorts of projects at scale and feel confident solving complex problems. You view “best practices” as a starting point for critical thinking, rather than a dogma to follow.</li><li>You have created Backbone (or a similar framework) single page applications before and can write JavaScript from scratch to implement a feature. Marionette and/or React experience is a bonus, but not required. We can help you pick it up.</li><li>Your code is not only reliable and performant for customers, but can be read, maintained and understood easily by other engineers on your team. The&nbsp;<a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/' rel='nofollow'>Zen of Python</a>&nbsp;resonates with you for any language.</li><li>You believe in writing unit and integration tests and have at least tried TDD. You like owning the quality of the code you write — QA doesn’t mean throwing it over the wall for someone else to test. You understand that some things are too costly to automate and must be manually tested to get it right.</li><li>You take pride in your work and ownership of the solutions you build. When a team member or customer is in need, you feel a sense of urgency to understand their pain and thoughtfully help.</li><li>You are curious and constantly learning. Believing that “a rising tide lifts all ships,” you make everyone around you better sharing what you have learned and looking for ways to improve both yourself and the team.</li><li>You enjoy the finish work and detail required to deliver a rich product with exceptional UX. From UI interactions to handling important edge cases, you take satisfaction in delivering a solid experience that delights the users, adds value to the business, and lasts over time.</li><li>You are a humble professional who wants to be challenged by the work and not the workload. You are willing to ask for help when necessary and unafraid to say, “I don’t know.” At the same time, you have the confidence to take on complex and challenging problems.</li><li>You are proactive about solving problems and improving things. You take the initiative to build tools and processes that will help everyone. When working in the codebase, you leave things better than you found them.</li><li>You are an excellent communicator who can write and speak with empathy for our customers and team. You can easily communicate complex ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences. Clear communication is super important in a remote culture like ours.</li><li>You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea. You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.</li><li>You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM - 6PM ET).</li></ul><div><h3>Benefits</h3></div><ul><li><span>Competitive Salary</span>&nbsp;- We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well.

Our&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/' rel='nofollow'>software</a>&nbsp;is used and trusted by businesses of every shape and size.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Designed to go the distance</span></div><div><br></div><div>Our mission is to foster the world’s customer-centric businesses by providing tools that serve customers in the most human, helpful way.

We overcome remote challenges through transparency, trust, and video conferencing. The reward is worth the effort—we’ll take talent, skill, and diverse perspectives over local geography any day.</div><div><br></div><div>Above all, we want Help Scout to be a place where passionate people can do their very best work. You won’t find any ping-pong tables or kegerators here. Instead, you’ll be surrounded by driven, supportive teammates who will push you to be better. We take work/life harmony seriously, too, as we want every career at Help Scout to be a long and satisfying one.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</span></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/diversity-inclusion/' rel='nofollow'>diversity and inclusion</a>.

    "content": "<p>We’re looking for a smart and ambitious Front End Developer who wants to crush code and leave a legacy within the National Health Service. Sound intriguing? Read on....</p><h4><b>ABOUT MESSLY</b></h4><p>Our vision is to revolutionise medical training and recruitment within the NHS. We believe that the digital infrastructure supporting the training and recruitment of NHS doctors isn’t fit for purpose. If you know anything about the NHS, you won’t need convincing. The NHS is on it’s knees lurching from one workforce crisis to the next.</p><h4><b>WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?</b></h4><p>Messly's vision is to be the online home for all UK doctors - a single digital platform providing doctors with unified training resources and data, peer-peer connectivity and recruitment services across the whole of the NHS. By bringing all the doctors to one place, we can provide the NHS with world-class digital infrastructure to directly engage with the medical workforce for temporary and permanent work, skipping the agencies and enabling game-changing financial savings.</p><p>Yes this sounds lofty and ambitious. But let’s be clear, this isn’t a passion project to keep our minds whirring after a dull night shift. Here’s why we are fully committed and extremely confident that we can make this happen:</p><h4>1. OUR TRACTION AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY</h4><p>We’re already delivering - over the last 18 months we’ve built a medical network of over 10,000 doctors and medical students. That’s 15% of the junior medical workforce. We’ve got 6 NHS Trusts using our recruitment services and are generating revenue. Our business model is proven and scalable and we have clear roadmap of how we’re going to win over the hearts and minds of doctors.</p><h4>2. OUR TEAM</h4><p>We strongly believe a solid team is critical for success. So we’ve gone out and built a crack team of clinicians, developers, designers, commercial experts and marketeers. Our founders are close-friends with significant medical and commercial experience. Our tech team are rockstar coders with incredible design flair. Our ops are run by an ex-Amazon whiz. Supporting our troops are an advisory board made up of some of the most well-connected entrepreneurs and healthcare experts, who are helping to embed Messly within the healthcare ecosystem. We’ve been backed by all leading healthcare innovation hubs including DigitalHealth.London, NHS Clinical Entrepreneurs Programme and InnovateUK.</p><h4>3. OUR FUNDING</h4><p>We’ve raised over £1,000,000 to focus on building the best digital tools and services for our doctors and NHS. Quite simply we can more patient and long-term than anyone else in the market to realise our bold vision.</p><h4>THE ROLE</h4><p>We're looking to hire a smart, curious, and enthusiastic front end developer who wants to make a name for themselves by building something something extraordinarily beautiful and functional. There'll be a lot of greenfield coding opportunities and you'll have the opportunity to retain full ownership of your code.</p><p>We're a young company, so you'll need to get your hands dirty and no two weeks will be the same. You will, of course, need to define your own work proactively and take ownership of the outputs. The ability to cope with uncertainty and rapid change is crucial.</p><p>We have a very flat hierarchy - you'll be working directly with our founders and CTO.</p><h4>ABOUT YOU</h4><p>You're smart, ambitious, like a challenge and are looking to move into a very rapidly growing startup order to fast-track your career. You're frustrated by slow-moving, process-heavy situations and excited by moving fast to solve challenging problems and delight customers. You'd like the opportunity to work in a varied role with responsibility and the scope for rapid personal development and change.</p><h4>REQUIREMENTS:</h4><p>1 or more years experience of JS front end development.</p><p>Experience developing with React.JS.</p><p>Knowledge of CSS and HTML.</p><p>UX/UI experience - including responsive/mobile design.</p><p>Portfolio of existing work to discuss.</p><h4>DESIRABLE TRAITS:</h4><p>Familiarity with functional programming.</p><h4>BENEFITS</h4><p>Highly competitive salary (based on experience) as well as other incentives where appropriate.</p><p>Very flexible working</p><p>Travel / development expenses.</p><p>Not one but two part-time office dogs.</p><p>Free (and frankly pretty good) barista coffee.</p><p>The role is full-time. Our offices are based in South West London, but we're open to flexible working as suits you and the role you'd like to create. Full-time remote working is an option - including for individuals who are based outside of the UK.</p>"

This means you’ll be able to flex your defensive programming skills and ensure our code works in harmony with a wide variety of browsers and other 3rd party scripts.<br><br>As our first dedicated front-end engineer, the team will often look to you for advice and direction. You’ll help shape our best practices, decide on frameworks and tooling, and refactor older or underperforming parts of the codebase. You’ll also be responsible for moving your projects forward, communicating your progress and milestones with others, and clearly documenting your work.<br><br>**Here are some things you may do on a given day:**<br><br>- Write some new JavaScript (with unit tests ) to improve part of the onboarding flow<br>- Track down a tricky bug in the email editor and develop a hotfix<br>- Research and write a pitch to migrate our CSS to a new framework<br>- Transform the design for a new part of the UI into HTML / CSS<br><br>**On the first day you will:**<br><br>- Meet your team and get familiar with how we work<br>- Setup your local environment and tooling<br>- Commit a small tweak to the codebase and ship it to production<br><br>**In the first week you will:**<br><br>- Develop, QA, review, and ship a small feature improvement<br>- Participate in code review for a teammate’s code<br>- Help a team member with fixing a bug<br><br>**In the first month you will:**<br><br>- Work closely with the product team to ship a large feature<br>- Participate in your first support rotation week and help our support team with escalated issues<br>- Publish a retrospective on your first large project to share successes &amp; planned improvements for the next project<br><br>**You**<br><br>You love writing JavaScript that’s clear, self-documenting, and standards-compliant, whether by itself, alongside jQuery, or as part of a JS framework like Vue, Angular, or React. You believe in combining JS with beautiful &amp; semantic HTML / CSS and are comfortable with supersets like CoffeeScript and templating languages like Slim. You’re also comfortable with Ruby / Rails and can move seamlessly between working on the back-end code that produces the data you need for front-end interactions.<br><br>You love beautiful design and working with others to transform concepts into real-world interfaces that are a joy to use. You love keeping up-to-date with the latest best practices and tools, and are constantly tweaking and improving the way you work.<br><br>You’re excited to solve engineering challenges in the most pragmatic way possible, and most importantly, you keep the end user in mind and love getting feedback from customers to help improve our products.<br><br>Finally, you can’t wait to join a small team that loves their work as much as you do, affords the opportunity to work on challenging &amp; interesting projects, continuously learn and improve, and constantly ship your work.

We enable a decentralized platform and network that connects providers and consumers of valuable data, while providing open access for developers to build services.</p>  <p>Ocean Protocol uses a thoughtful application of both technology and governance for more equitable&nbsp;outcomes for users of data.</p>  <p>We are looking for a talented Frontend Developer to assist in creating awesome user experiences in all of Ocean Protocol’s web touch points. The ideal candidate will have top Frontend skills, including an eye for UI design and a passion for delivering high quality UX.</p>  <p>You will be one of the first members of the Ocean Protocol UI team, closely working with other designers &amp; UI developers.</p>  <p>At Ocean Protocol we design mostly in the browser, we like high-quality code, enjoyable documentation, mobile-first &amp; accessible user interfaces, and babelified static builds. We follow a JAMstack approach for all our frontend needs.</p>  <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Create high quality, highly maintainable, highly performant, and highly scalable user interfaces for various use cases</li>   <li>Assist in architecting and developing frontend applications and features of the Ocean Protocol product</li>   <li>Assist in developing features for the Ocean Protocol website</li>   <li>Create microservices</li>   <li>Ensure brand consistency across all of our web touch points by building out and maintaining our components-based design system</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Skills and Experience</strong></p>  <p><em><strong>Requirements</strong></em></p>  <ul>   <li>10+ years of proven work experience with various front-end technologies &amp; frameworks</li>   <li>Highly skilled in JavaScript, knowledge of advanced CSS techniques and modern JS stack</li>   <li>Understanding of the entire web development process (design, development and deployment) in a serverless environment</li>   <li>Experience with React.js, Webpack &amp; generally with the Node.js ecosystem</li>   <li>Experience with browser testing tools like Jest, Puppeteer, etc.</li>   <li>Basic knowledge of dApps and blockchain-based solutions</li>   <li>Advanced usage of emojis, gifs, and memes in your daily work routine</li>  </ul>  <p><em><strong>Nice to haves</strong></em></p>  <ul>   <li>Understanding of basic design principles and an eye for all the little details in UI design</li>   <li>Created and/or maintained an open source project</li>   <li>Basic knowledge of Design tools like Sketch or Affinity</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>The good stuff</strong></p>  <p>We’re a tight-knit international team based in Berlin. We’re always building and shipping, but with an appreciation for the theoretical. We work closely with our users, technology partners, and engage with the global decentralization community on and offline.</p>  <p>From our very beginnings having a female cofounder: we are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We strongly encourage applications from women, transgender or non-binary people, people of color, people with disabilities, or anyone traditionally underrepresented in tech.</p>  <p><strong>Location:</strong> We’re in Berlin, Germany. If you don’t know much about Berlin, don’t fret. Almost all of us have immigrated here, from all over the world, from Canada to India, from Italy to USA. And we love it!</p>  <p><strong>Office time:</strong> We trust you to do your job, and doing your job is about getting the task done, not us looking over your shoulder. In general we try to be around the office here in Berlin but as with our technology, our team is often distributed and our processes are optimized so work can get done in a mix of on-site and remote work. If you feel you’re most effective working from a top of a mountain, please do.</p>  <p><strong>Choice of tech:</strong> We provide you with either a top-notch Dell or MacBook Pro laptop, and with everything else you need and chose to get your work done.</p>  <p><strong>Immigration:</strong> We’ll hold your hand in the visa / immigration process, which is smooth and surprisingly fast.</p>  <p><strong>Language:</strong> We speak English in the office. And in fact if you only speak English, you can easily get by in Berlin. (As is the case for many of our employees.)</p>  <p><strong>Transit:</strong> We’re spoiled, Berlin has one of the best public transit systems in the world. Our office is near a connection point of the underground (U-bahn) and trams. Berlin also has safe bike lines all throughout the city; you can park your bike in the office. We offer to reimburse half of you annual public transport ticket.</p>  <p><strong>Time off:</strong> Health first. Without health and happiness, what is left? So, our minimum paid leave per year is 25 days, plus statutory national holidays.</p>  <p><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Germany has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. Some of the nation’s top university hospitals are here in Berlin. Many of us have a family doctor just down the street from our office. Berlin is also great for sports.</p>  <p><strong>Parenting, Parental Leave:</strong> We love kids! And we recognize the time that parents need for their children’s’ well-being, not to mention their own well-being! So we want to give all the space in the world to new parents who wish to spend time with their children: mothers get fully paid maternity leave six weeks prior to birth and eight weeks after. In addition, there are 14 months of 2/3 paid leave, split between the parents according to the parents’ choice. And for general parental responsibilities that invariably come up, by all means, go attend to your child. We trust that you are a professional and know how to balance your time.</p>  <p><strong>Professional and Personal Growth:</strong> Ocean Protocol is at the epicenter of blockchains + big data + AI, so if you’re not learning, then something’s wrong! We’ll be giving you opportunities to represent us speaking at conferences, hosting hackathons, writing, and more. Finally, we give you an annual self-development budget that you choose as you wish to spend on books, personal conferences, and other things to grow yourself.</p>  <p><strong>Your next step?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Are you up for working in an awesome team, learning a ton, and bringing blockchain to the masses? Please, send your application to jobs@oceanprotocol.com with:</p>  <ul>   <li>Resume</li>   <li>Cover letter</li>   <li>Work samples</li>  </ul> </div><a href='mailto:jobs@oceanprotocol.com' rel='nofollow'>Apply for this position</a>"

We’re working with ICOs, exploring the identity space, and looking forward to open-sourcing financial technology, which is desperately lacking appropriate and inclusive international standards.</p><p>Fractal’s 6-strong engineering team is known for its sky-high standards and aspirations. Software is hard, and we know it takes curiosity, passion, discipline, and patience to get it right.</p><p><strong>Your Profile</strong></p><p>There's a specific kind of person we're looking for. We understand we’re describing a rare breed, so it’s ok if you don’t meet all these requirements.</p><ul><li>You consider yourself a senior software engineer, and so do all of you peers.</li><li>You understand that “move fast and break things” is only a good philosophy when what you build is inconsequential.</li><li>You're excited to break out of an application's code and think about the system as a whole (tweaking nginx configs, thinking about load balancers, worrying about queues and their throughput).</li><li>You're the person your friends turn to when they hear about that new tech in Hacker News. They do that because you’re up to speed with the current trends and great at breaking down complex technology in a way that your juniors can grasp.</li><li>Someone at our team has done mutation testing by hand because they’re that careful about things. You don’t think this is crazy, and maybe have done the same yourself.</li><li>You get really angry if someone tries to takes away your agile, or your tests, or your continuous delivery, or.... You get the point.</li></ul><p><strong>Our values</strong></p><p>It’s always difficult to accurately write about one’s values in a way that captures their subtlety, but here's a decent start. We can chat more about it during the application process.</p><ul><li>Gather great talent: Have the best peers you could ask for, people you can continuously teach and learn with. We know A-players want to work with other A-players.</li><li>Enforce transparency: Every decision's process is documented in the clear, all information is available to everyone (to the extent of the law).</li><li>Include everyone: Consider all ideas from anyone. Even if it isn't your area of expertise, we encourage you to ask questions and contribute in any way you feel inclined.</li><li>Don't worry about salaries: We want our engineers thinking about code, not money. All engineers get paid enough to live a comfortable lifestyle.</li><li>Promote authenticity: We have an informal environment, and we believe getting along well is fundamental. Everyone's different and we're going to spend a third of our lives together, so we make sure everyone feels welcome.</li></ul><h3>Main requirements</h3><ul><li><p>You've built at least a handful of websites by now, of which at least one really challenged your software design skills and dealt with more than 10 concurrent users</p></li><li><p>DFA, BFS, DFS, A: these are not just words for you. You might not be totally in the know, but you'd know where to start. You can reason about algorithmic complexity and know which trade-offs to make</p></li><li>Your education and years of experience don’t matter but, when we speak, we need to feel like you’ve been doing this forever.</li><li><p>We build our web applications mostly in <strong>Ruby/Rails</strong> for the back-end and <strong>JavaScript/React</strong> for the front-end. We also have a bunch of services running <strong>Go.</strong> Our infra is docker-containerized and sits on <strong>AWS</strong> (Fargate/ECS and RDS PostgreSQL) and is managed through <strong>Terraform</strong>. We work with <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, <strong>Ethereum</strong> (and <strong>Solidity</strong>), and <strong>Lisk</strong>.</p></li></ul><h3>Nice to have</h3><ul><li>Understanding of blockchain technology, distributed systems, and cryptography.</li></ul><h3>Perks</h3><ul><li>Remote work, flexible hours, world-class engineering team</li></ul><p></p>"

Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in Florida and be able to interact in person with our team in Clearwater, FL. No contractors or agencies. Seriously. </span></p><p><span>Why We Started Guardian Trust</span></p><p><span>Guardian Trust was created for the sole purpose of helping people with disabilities financially qualify for public assistance programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). </span></p><p><span>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is hefty, and we accomplish it by leveraging technology and hiring the best.</span></p><p><span>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</span></p><p><span>The development shop we’ve partnered with over the last few years, Very, is a remote-first company, and we’ve fully embraced this concept alongside them. About 30% of the Very dev team works out of HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. &nbsp;Currently, the Guardian Trust staff works full-time in Clearwater, FL. However, we see the benefit of remote work and welcome engineers who would like to work mostly remote. We ask that from time to time you come to the office to work directly with our staff using our trust management software. Especially in the beginning, we feel it’s essential to fully understand our workflows and advise on system improvement. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>What You’ll Be Working On</span></p><p><span>Guardian in collaboration with Very, has built custom web-based CRM software to manage back-office workflows and the day-to-day operations of Trust management. You will have the opportunity to shape and grow the user experience to facilitate intuitive and efficient use. The web application integrates with a robust accounting system as well as a check-writing service. There is a strong focus on availability in the face of degraded performance from integrations. As such, you will be able to leverage the strengths of Elixir to continue providing a high-quality experience as part of the Guardian team.</span></p><ul><li><span>Elixir (Phoenix)</span></li><li><span>JavaScript (React)</span></li><li><span>Redis</span></li><li><span>Postgres</span></li><li><span>AWS</span></li><li><span>Heroku</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This Role: Senior Software Engineer</span></p><p><span>Your job will be to not only add on to our platform, but also to listen to the team using it and make continuous recommendations for improvement. While the Guardian Trust team doesn’t have a degree in programming, they truly understand leveraging smart software and taking care of their customers. </span></p><p><span>We’ve got lofty goals for growth— striving to help as many people with disabilities as possible. As a Senior Software Engineer at Guardian Trust, we expect you to not only bring a high level of programming expertise, but also a high-level of product ownership. We value collaboration, as well as exceptional communication with the ability to distill complex ideas in layman’s terms. We also value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineer to be as good a practitioner as they are a leader and teacher. </span></p><p><span>When you start working at Guardian, you’ll pair with our development partner, Very, to learn the ropes of the product and code-base, third-party integrations, deployment, business decisions, etc. Very will continue to be part of the code review process to ensure Guardian is well taken care of—and you’re set up for success.</span></p><p><span>How We Operate</span></p><p><span>We emphasize that outstanding people providing excellent service are the key to our success. We expect our employees to be careful and conscientious in their performance of duties, thoughtful and considerate of other people and courteous and helpful when dealing with other employees. We encourage our employees to improve proficiency in their respective jobs and to participate in continuing education opportunities that are relevant to their position.</span></p><p><span>Our standard workweek is Monday - Friday, and our office is open between the hours of 8:30 am and 5:00 pm. </span></p><p><span>How You’ll Be Compensated</span></p><p><span>We believe in fair compensation, depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $120,000 annually upon joining the company. We have an excellent health plan available to our employees, and we cover 100% of the cost of the premium for our employee and their families. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a maximum of a 3% match based upon the percentage you contribute. </span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>How To Apply</span></p><p><span>This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in Florida. Thanks!</span></p><p><span>To apply, please send us a note to jobs-gt@verypossible.com with {{Guardian Trust Engineer}} in the subject line. Please include the following:</span></p><ol><li><span>What’s most important to you from a company culture and operating environment?</span></li><li><span>What are the biggest things that de-motivate you and make you unhappy when it comes to being an independent engineer within a company?</span></li><li><span>Your resume</span></li><li><span>Code samples with comments explaining what you did and how you architected the code.</span></li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>"

We are a growing team of 6 passionate people with plans to expand rapidly by the end of 2018.<br><br>With multiple new product launches on the horizon and several more planned before the end of the year, you will be joining the company at a time of explosive growth. Your presence will have a very real impact on the company’s value.<br><br>We are looking for a Frontend Web Developer to join our tech team’s efforts to supercharge our PHP web application. You will be working directly with Pierre-Camille, our founder, who developed the original product from scratch, as well as with all members of the tech, marketing, and success teams.<br><br>Our company is fully distributed and remote. We believe and fully embrace that your best environment is wherever you - personally - feel the most productive and comfortable for day-to-day work. Nevertheless, we organise frequent meetups and retreats for the team to physically meet throughout the year. The last two trips were to Lisbon/Cascais and Paris!<br><br><br><br>⭐️ **What you will do: **⭐️<br><br>• You will be our web app’s interior designer.<br><br>• You will be responsible both for our public site’s and the web app’s frontend code, through layout, elegant presentation, visual functionality, and compatibility across a wide range of browser versions and form factors.<br><br>• You will be in charge of completely overhauling our legacy, spaghetti frontend javascript into a unified, beautifully-structured, and testable web app.<br><br>• You will take charge of your own work and proactively suggest improvements.<br><br>• In a remote environment you will be responsible for your own time and results – there will be no babysitting.<br><br><br><br>✅ **What you will need to succeed:** ✅<br><br>• UX Geek: you know how to strike the right balance between swanky animation and Zen-like simplicity to drive great user experiences.<br><br>• Independent: you are self-motivated, take initiative, and are a strong communicator. You are results-driven and willing to learn and improve yourself.<br><br>• Technical Ninja: proficient at vanilla Javascript and PHP, Vue.js 2.x or Angular 4/5/6, Twig/Blade/Handlebars templating, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3 (all the good stuff), semantic/schema markup, LESS/SCSS, Webpack and/or Gulp, and Git, backed by 5+ years of frontend development experience.<br><br>• Interface Artisan: you can clearly describe data structure requirements as well as points of entry for your frontend code, enabling other developers to integrate their frontend and backend code painlessly.<br><br>• Caring Developer: you recognise that your code and work impact not only the customers but also the rest of the team. You conduct yourself with professionalism and respect not only in meetings but also in how you structure your code and in the documentation that you write.<br><br>• Superb English fluency: we are an international team and clear communication is vital. It goes without saying (but we’ll say it anyway) that you absolutely must have the ability to participate in frequent video meetings.<br><br>• The product team is based in Europe, so at the moment we are looking for developers who are based within the same general time zones (UTC±3). <br><br><br><br> **Brownie points:** <br><br>• You have experience with unit and automated functionality testing of frontend code using tools like Jasmine, Karma, Chai, Selenium, PhantomJS, and/or Sinon.<br><br>• Interactive Git rebasing doesn’t sound like voodoo to you.<br><br>• You’ve used in Git commit messages.<br><br>• You’re pretty darn good at interface design and color palettes.<br><br>• Typescript experience.<br><br>(Let us know how many  you deserve.)<br><br><br><br> **What we offer:** <br><br>• Competitive salary, including the possibility of stock options.<br><br>• Ample paid leave, in addition to maternity and paternity leave.<br><br>• A great support structure: we are here for you.<br><br>• Flexible contract. You will work independently where you are most productive and happiest, with flexible weekday hours.<br><br>• All the resources and tools that you need to succeed <br><br>• Join a fast-growing startup and be part of the force that shapes the company in the years to come!<br><h2>Requirements</h2>We are solving global short-term rental automation.

You will enjoy all of the benefits of working in a startup, the freedom to innovate, to explore new technologies and to use your experience and ideas to directly influence the business.<br /><br />*---- Why ClickMechanic ----*<br /><br />ClickMechanic is a marketplace for vehicle repairs. Our platform enables customers to acquire real-time industry-standard quotes for repairs (a first in Europe), services and diagnostics, and quickly book a vetted mechanic online. Our mission is to bring trust and transparency to car repair.<br /><br />Founded in 2012, the company has grown quickly to offer nationwide coverage and is backed by such institutional investors as 500 Startups and Forward Partners, and angel investors including the former CEO of JustEat and Chairman of Treatwell.<br /><br />Vehicle repair is a huge market, ripe for technology disruption. There are millions of consumers, tera- or even peta-bytes of potentially underused data, with an exceptional logistics infrastructure (parts distribution).<br /><br />*---- The Role ----*<br /><br />As a full-stack developer in a small team, you will work across all aspects of the product from architecture and DevOps to code reviews and tech support. Working alongside our CTO & Head of Engineering, you will deliver new features and continually improve our existing code.<br /><br />Technology underpins our entire business. We’ve built an industry-leading quote engine and mobile Mechanic App. We consume millions of rows of third-party automotive data and have implemented machine learning to improve the accuracy of our quotes.<br /><br />*---- Responsibilities ----*<br /><br />* Writing well-tested production code in Ruby and JavaScript.<br />* Refactoring and rearchitecting legacy code where appropriate to ensure you always leave it better than you found it.<br />* Reviewing code fairly and honestly; and receiving code reviews openly on each of your pull requests.<br />* Collaboration with business stakeholders to develop requirements and expectations.<br />* Collaboration with technical stakeholders to discuss constraints and opportunities.<br />* Monitoring our production systems and providing technical support to the business.<br />* Maintaining our development pipeline and toolchain.<br />* Innovation and self-led learning.<br /><br />*---- Our Technology ----*<br /><br />As a startup, we prefer open-source technologies. Our main app is built with Ruby (on Rails) and is hosted on Heroku and AWS. We use both PostgreSQL and SQL Server relational databases and also MongoDB and Elasticsearch NoSQL databases.<br /><br />Our mobile Mechanic App is built on JQuery mobile and we are planning to rearchitect this system onto a more modern framework (e.g. React) soon.<br /><br />Our development pipeline utilises Jira, Git, GitHub, Docker, Webpack, Grunt and CircleCI.<br /><br />*---- Requirements ----*<br /><br />Your potential is much more important to us than a list of characteristics. Nevertheless, here is a list of characteristics that we hope already apply to you, or that you’re very keen to develop:<br />* You consider yourself fairly expert in at least one OO programming language (not necessarily Ruby).<br />* You have built a production web application using an MVC (or equivalent) framework (e.g. Ruby on Rails).<br />* The terms OOP, SOLID and TDD make you feel warm inside.<br />* You can write complicated SQL statements directly in the console without a query designer.<br />* Unix, Linux, Heroku, GitHub and NoSQL are not just made-up words to you.<br />* You can describe JavaScript as a functional, prototypal language and know what that means.<br />* You have strong Git-fu and can perform interactive rebases from the command line.<br />* You’re not afraid to get stuck into DevOps and have a go at, say, implementing Docker in a CI pipeline.<br />* You write your best code when pair-programming with another developer regardless of their experience.<br />* You wouldn't write a line of production code without writing a failing test first, because that’s how it’s done, right?<br />* You read about programming and technology because it’s a passion, not just a profession.<br />* You see legacy code as an exciting opportunity to innovate and make things better.<br /><br />*---- Benefits ----*<br /><br />* Working with leading open-source technologies in an agile team.<br />* A culture that embraces flexibility, and rewards growth and innovation.<br />* The opportunity to directly contribute to the success of the business every day.<br />* A competitive package including company pension and share options.<br />* MacBook Pro as standard.<br />* 10% innovation time.<br />* Manage your own training budget.<br />* Tea, coffee, fruit, snacks and Friday beers provided!<br />* Bringing trust and transparency to an industry which is widely recognised for high levels customer dissatisfaction."

Since then, our growth has been steady and organic, and we've built a great business with several £million in annual revenue and very healthy profits.<br /><br />A few years ago we launched Flow XO, a business messaging and chatbots product. Flow XO is already a leader in its market with users all over the world.<br /><br />**Our plan for growth**<br /><br />We're now working on a 3 year plan to accelerate our growth and bring the FLG and Flow XO products closer together.<br /><br />The foundations are there - strong history, good revenues, excellent profits, amazing people in both the team and customers.<br /><br />Our plans include a new focus on sales and marketing, and a revamped approach to product, which will see FLG and Flow XO become an expanded product family and see new products brought into the mix.<br /><br />**The role**<br /><br />As the single lead developer and coach in the team, it will be your job to work alongside the product manager to turn product plans into well architected software products.<br /><br />About half the time you'll be managing, coaching and organising the team. The rest of the time, you'll be working on code alongside the rest of the team.<br /><br />You'll be working on both the front-end (React/Redux and Angular) and also the back-end (Node, MongoDB & Redis) plus anything else we bring into the picture for our new products. The work is challenging, as we're building complex products with interesting problems around UX, scaling, and architecture.<br /><br />Although there's obviously some complexity in the codebase, we've worked hard to reduce technical debt, achieve excellent test coverage, and follow conventions where possible. So you'll be joining projects where most of the working day is spent thinking about the future rather than catching up with the past.<br /><br />Our product roadmap means there is likely to be whole new products being actively worked on every 3-6 months, at least for the next few years.<br /><br />**Is this you?**<br /><br />* You have a few years' experience of building full-stack JavaScript web apps<br />* You currently have team leadership responsibilities and want to develop that further. We need you to lead technical discussion to collaborate with the team and nurture innovation whilst always having an eye on the commercial strategy. We also need you to act as our scrum master (or delegate the responsibility elsewhere)<br />* You want to coach and develop other members of the team around you<br />* You're engaging, approachable and pragmatic<br />* You're a great communicator<br />* Always be considering 'what if', so you can write code and design logic that is robust and secure<br /><br />If this is you, please come and join our team. Our customers need you.<br /><br />**The rewards**<br /><br />This is a rare opportunity to transform something great into something incredible.<br /><br />A chance to plot the businesses growth and point proudly to when you joined the business, just before the curve takes that sharp upwards turn.<br /><br />As well as a rewarding challenge, we also offer:<br /><br />* A very competitive salary<br />* Flexible working hours<br />* Part-time remote working available<br />* Our product team is based in Manchester City Centre in a cool office. We don't care about your gender, race, sexuality, age, whether you have disabilities we need to accommodate, etc. - we're simply looking for someone that can deliver.<br /><br />**Next steps**<br /><br />The first step is to send us your current CV and write us an intro.<br /><br />The intro is important, you need to explain (succinctly) how you fit into the picture.<br /><br />We're looking forward to hearing from you. Don't delay."

We are well funded and backed by one of the UK’s most successful tech accelerators, Entrepreneur First.</p><p>We’re developing a range of applications and technologies to record, monitor and analyse container ship cargo operations (i.e. the process of moving containers on and off a ship in port), to ensure ships depart early and consume less fuel on voyage. Our long-term goal is to bring the widespread adoption of autonomous technologies to merchant ships.</p><p>Voyages by ship are legally classed as ‘adventures’. We see CargoMate as an adventure too; driven by passionate problem solvers who are resilient when faced with a storm. We reach our destination by working as one crew.</p><p>Your Role</p><p>We care about our craft and it’s important to us that you do as well. We’re looking for someone who’s willing to learn on the job, as well as teach others. You write code that you’re proud of as you know you and your team members will be the ones maintaining and adding new features to it.</p><p>You’ll work on an Android-only React Native app that lets users on container ships across the world keep their progress up to date. Skills in Android development will come in handy as React Native has its limits.</p><p>You’ll collaborate closely with the rest of the tech team as we’ve created an initial MVP and are now looking to create a new version that’s will be used on thousands of ships. You’ll build new features, prototype new ideas, do code reviews, mentor future team members as well as have mentors around you. We keep up to date with the latest tech but know that bleeding edge usually isn’t optimal for production. You don’t have to know our whole tech stack but it’s important that you’re willing to learn.</p><p>For this role, mobile development skills and culture fit are more important than a formal education. We don’t do whiteboard interviews or ask you how many golf balls fit in a 747. You will get to show that you know what you’re doing by coding on your own machine as part of the interview process.</p><p>We’re a tight-knit team with people from many different cultures. We enjoy each other’s company and it’s therefore important that you’re a great fit for our company culture.</p><p>Remote work is an option after first spending three months in our offices in central Richmond upon Thames.

You’ll be responsible for developing new user-facing features and implementing them following well-known React.js workflows (such as Redux).

A commitment to collaborative problem solving, sophisticated design, and product quality is important.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rotageek</b></p><p>A few years ago, Rotageek was a small side project; our CEO, an A&amp;E doctor, wanted to improve scheduling in his hospital department.

Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away £800 of food each year - collectively adding up to £15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile & web apps. Over the past 2 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. <br /><br />We now have over 465,000 users who have together shared well over half a million portions of food – with food being successfully shared in 32 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our volunteer programme, with over 19,000 people reaching out to spread the word about OLIO in their local community and rescue unsold food.<br /><br />OLIO is now looking to grow our core team as we embark upon the next exciting phase in our journey.<br /><br />*JOIN OUR TEAM!*<br /><br />In order to accelerate OLIO to its next level in growth and impact, we are recruiting for a Data Analyst & Dashboard Developer, who will report into Viv Taylor, Product Manager.<br /><br />In this role you will be responsible for:<br /><br />* Data Analysis: Analysing key business questions in our burgeoning data via an SQL interface (both through<br />GUI and command line tools)<br />* Data Visualization: Development of a “data dashboard” for the company to help us interrogate our data<br />visually and in a user friendly manner<br />* Data Innovation: Liaison with our broader OLIO team to ensure that the right questions are being asked of<br />our growing datasets, in the right order.<br />* Data Exploration: Evaluation of the effects of specific initiatives/experiments at OLIO, generating and<br />presenting reports of their efficacy<br />* Setup of regular reports that provide insight into ongoing company/departmental performance.<br />* Assisting with online ad creative endeavours, their implementation and analysing their impact<br /><br />Once you have proven yourself you will have great freedom and autonomy, coupled with an enormous opportunity for personal development.

There’s no excuse for being chased around the internet by images of products you’ve already bought. It’s irritating for the end user and counterproductive for the company attempting to sell their products or services. Using our tooling marketers can refine their targeting such that the ads are only shown to people who have shown genuine interest.<br /><br />WORKING AT DRIFTROCK<br /><br />Driftrock’s tooling provides our users with a way to receive, transform, track and optimise leads from social channels. Currently these tools look and feel very separate so we’re in the process of bringing them together, with the view to having Driftrock be more of a platform than a set of tools. Other problems we’re solving, and are looking to solve in the near future, include:<br />. How to securely and safely handle personally identifying information;<br />. How to enrich incoming data with information that will help our users decide on the best next steps for their leads;<br />. What reports to provide to our users such that they can see if their efforts are resulting in quality leads and what they can do to improve.<br /><br />The technology is a mixture of Ruby, Elixir and React applications hosted on Kubernetes and Google Cloud. We make use of Redis and Postgres for data storage and RabbitMQ for event processing.<br /><br />You will be expected to:<br />. Build RESTful APIs, event-based systems and front-end applications;<br />. Work with well-known public APIs like Facebook and LinkedIn;<br />. Design and improve user experience;<br />. Support production systems;<br />. Manage cloud infrastructure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE TEAM<br /><br />We’re a small team of 15 people at Driftrock but we’re growing. Our product development team is 7 people with 6 developers and 1 CTO, this means that anyone we bring in can have a huge impact on the culture and practices of the team. <br /><br />We believe in continuous improvement and we are constantly refining and improving how we work and communicate. One of the ways we do this is by performing fortnightly retrospectives, which are often run by different team members. <br /><br />Currently we make use of daily standups and weekly prioritisation meetings to ensure we're pulling in the same direction and maintaining our focus of delivering value to our end users early and often.<br /><br />ABOUT YOU<br /><br />. You should be keen to learn and improve technical, product and personal skills;<br />. You want to be involved in crafting products whilst building on the culture and process of the product team;<br />. You are happy working in a small team, collaborating closely with other engineers as well as our product and sales teams;<br />. You can provide new and diverse viewpoints for our technical and product discussions;<br />. You are interested in agile practices such as continuous delivery, TDD, pair programming, code reviews and retrospectives;<br />. You are keen to ensure there is a high standard of quality and security in the software we produce as a team;<br />. You have had some exposure to Ruby, Elixir or Javascript (we do not expect you to have experience in all of those languages); <br />. You have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<br /><br />The interview process has some flexibility but is primarily made up of the following stages:<br /><br />. An initial phone conversation with an engineer;<br />. A take home technical test/coding challenge;<br />. Followed by an on-site pairing interview, where we'll build on your code challenge solution. We then do an informal problem solving task and we finish up with an informal chat with the rest of the team;<br /><br />We try our hardest to reduce the amount of stress involved in the process, we’re not trying to catch you out with trick questions and if at any point (even on the take home test) you have any questions for us we encourage you to ask them.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />. You will work with passionate and smart people, in an environment where we firmly believe in sharing knowledge;<br />. You will be an integral part of a growing and innovative tech startup;<br />. You can be enrolled to the Company’s pension scheme;<br />. The company atmosphere is social and friendly; <br />. You will be part of fun monthly team events.<br /><br /><br />We will not be considering any recruitment agencies for this role.<br /><br />&quot;By applying for this job you hereby give us permission to store your data on our secure applicant tracking system and to contact you with regards to Driftrock Ltd and our job opportunities. We will store your data for a year before deleting all individually identifiable information. If you wish data to be deleted sooner, respond to this email requesting the deletion of your data&quot;."

    "content": "Location: Old Street, London N1<br /><br />Start Date: ASAP<br /><br />Salary: depending on experience and skill level<br /><br />WHO ARE DRIFTROCK?<br /><br />Driftrock was started with the aim of making advertising through social channels better. There’s no excuse for being chased around the internet by images of products you’ve already bought. It’s irritating for the end user and counterproductive for the company attempting to sell their products or services. Using our tooling marketers can refine their targeting such that the ads are only shown to people who have shown genuine interest.<br /><br />WORKING AT DRIFTROCK<br /><br />Driftrock’s tooling provides our users with a way to receive, transform, track and optimise leads from social channels. Currently these tools look and feel very separate so we’re in the process of bringing them together, with the view to having Driftrock be more of a platform than a set of tools. Other problems we’re solving, and are looking to solve in the near future, include:<br /><br />* How to securely and safely handle personally identifying information; <br />* How to enrich incoming data with information that will help our users decide on the best next steps for their leads; <br />* What reports to provide to our users such that they can see if their efforts are resulting in quality leads and what they can do to improve.<br /><br />The technology is a mixture of Ruby, Elixir and React applications hosted on Kubernetes and Google Cloud. We make use of Redis and Postgres for data storage and RabbitMQ for event processing.<br /><br />You will be expected to:<br /><br />* Build RESTful APIs, event-based systems and front-end applications; <br />* Work with well-known public APIs like Facebook and LinkedIn; <br />* Design and improve user experience; <br />* Support production systems; <br />* Manage cloud infrastructure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE TEAM<br /><br />We’re a small team of 15 people at Driftrock but we’re growing. Our product development team is 7 people with 6 developers and 1 CTO, this means that anyone we bring in can have a huge impact on the culture and practices of the team.<br /><br />We believe in continuous improvement and we are constantly refining and improving how we work and communicate. One of the ways we do this is by performing fortnightly retrospectives, which are often run by different team members.<br /><br />Currently we make use of daily standups and weekly prioritisation meetings to ensure we're pulling in the same direction and maintaining our focus of delivering value to our end users early and often.<br /><br />ABOUT YOU<br /><br />* You should be keen to learn and improve technical, product and personal skills; <br />* You want to be involved in crafting products whilst building on the culture and process of the product team; <br />* You are happy working in a small team, collaborating closely with other engineers as well as our product and sales teams; <br />* You can provide new and diverse viewpoints for our technical and product discussions; <br />* You are interested in agile practices such as continuous delivery, TDD, pair programming, code reviews and retrospectives; <br />* You are keen to ensure there is a high standard of quality and security in the software we produce as a team; <br />* You are interested in mentoring and coach other team members; <br />* You have had some exposure to Ruby, Elixir or Javascript (we do not expect you to have experience in all of those languages); <br />* You have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<br /><br />The interview process has some flexibility but is primarily made up of the following stages:<br /><br />* An initial phone conversation with an engineer; <br />* A take home technical test/coding challenge; <br />* Followed by an on-site pairing interview, where we'll build on your code challenge solution. We then do an informal problem solving task and we finish up with an informal chat with the rest of the team. <br /><br />We try our hardest to reduce the amount of stress involved in the process, we’re not trying to catch you out with trick questions and if at any point (even on the take home test) you have any questions for us we encourage you to ask them.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />* You will work with passionate and smart people, in an environment where we firmly believe in sharing knowledge; <br />* You will be an integral part of a growing and innovative tech startup; <br />* You can be enrolled to the Company’s pension scheme; <br />* The company atmosphere is social and friendly; <br />* You will be part of fun monthly team events.<br /><br />We will not be considering any recruitment agencies for this role.<br /><br />&quot;By applying for this job you hereby give us permission to store your data on our secure applicant tracking system and to contact you with regards to Driftrock Ltd and our job opportunities. We will store your data for a year before deleting all individually identifiable information. If you wish data to be deleted sooner, respond to this email requesting the deletion of your data&quot;."
