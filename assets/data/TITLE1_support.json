We are a fully <strong>remote team</strong> and are looking for someone based in a European timezone.</p><p><strong>Our product Tower helps over 100,000 users in companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft to easily &amp; productively work with the Git version control system.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Providing helpful &amp; qualified <strong>customer support</strong> is an important part of our own aspiration. With Tower being a software development tool, customer questions are mostly technical. Therefore, we're looking for someone with a background in software development to help our customers with their technical questions on Git and version control.You'll work closely with our software engineers and be part of a friendly, open, and reliable team of professionals.</p><h3>Job</h3><ul><li>you'll provide <strong>support to our customers</strong> and prospective customers via our ticketing system (no phone or chat support)</li><li>you accept <strong>accountability</strong> for providing a <strong>fast, high-quality, and helpful support experience</strong> for our customers (and improve our process where possible)</li><li>questions range from simple sales and billing issues to bug reports and <strong>complex technical problems</strong> with Git and web app setups</li><li>you'll <strong>document issues and communicate with our engineering teams</strong> in search for solutions to our customers' problems</li><li>you're happy to help our engineering team with <strong>testing and QA</strong></li><li>you can <strong>deal with our product management saying &quot;no&quot;</strong> to many feature requests and fixes because you understand that, as a small team, our resources are painfully limited</li><li>optional: in case you are proficient with PHP / CSS3 / JS, you might also want to help us develop and maintain our many web projects (the Tower website and blog, our learning platform, the Tower online documentation...)</li></ul><h3>Skills</h3><ul><li>3+ years background in web / software development</li><li>Fluent in English with excellent writing / grammar skills</li><li>Advanced knowledge of Git and version control</li><li>Experience writing bug reports or other technical documents</li><li>Experience on both macOS and Windows</li><li>You love to help people with technical / dev problems</li><li>You are a good and mindful communicator</li></ul><h3>You</h3><ul><li> very reliable &amp; thorough: you accept responsibility for your own work and its quality</li><li>hungry to be part of a team that creates things that matter</li><li>self-motivated and capable of working from home</li><li>open to discussions and a mindful communicator</li><li>willing to be part of a team &amp; yet able to work independently</li><li>paying attention to details</li><li>open-minded and respectful – regarding people, technologies and projects</li><li>happy to become part of a small team of friendly &amp; skilled professionals</li></ul><h3>About Tower &amp; fournova</h3><p>We are a small, fully remote software company based in Germany. Founded in 2010, we set out to make Git’s powerful feature set accessible to developers, designers, and non-technical people.</p><p><strong>Today, our software Tower is the best Git client for Mac and Windows and is used by over 100,000 customers - from startups to Fortune 100 companies.</strong></p><p>We know we can achieve great goals only with the help of our peers. And at fournova, we are blessed to work in a team of extraordinary people. We’re not looking for someone to do the job. We’re looking for someone to join the team.</p><h3>Values at fournova</h3><p>We are a team driven by values. Not the ones that look nice on a poster, but ones that are truly and honestly lived.</p><ul><li><p><strong>TRUST</strong>&nbsp;- We believe our colleagues make good &amp; fair decisions. For example when they take as many vacation days as they need (there's no maximum number of holidays, but a minimum of 24 days). Or when they handle company money responsibly (you can make any purchases without asking for permission). We don't control or micro-manage people.</p></li><li><p><strong>RELIABILITY</strong>&nbsp;- At fournova, you're allowed to make any decision. Even if it's outside of your typical scope of duty. As a consequence, however, you also have to accept responsibility. We rely on our teammates to do their very best work.</p></li><li><p><strong>RESPECT</strong>&nbsp;- We have a deep and sincere respect for each other. Both on a professional and on a personal level. We know we can achieve great goals only with the help of our peers.</p></li><li><p><strong>HUMILITY</strong>&nbsp;- We do what's best for the team. This shows when you're supporting a team decision even if you'd prefer something else. And this shows when making profits: we donate 10% to a good cause every year.</p></li><li><p><strong>HEALTH</strong>&nbsp;- We require everyone to give 100%. But not more than that! Working long hours or weekends is rarely seen at fournova. If you want, you can even choose to work only a 4-day week. We encourage you to pursue a life beyond work!</p></li><li><p><strong>PRAGMATISM</strong>&nbsp;- We concentrate on the tasks that matter. Many things at fournova could be improved. But reality limits our time and energy in a painful way. To get meaningful work done, we need to live with countless little annoyances and concentrate on the things that bring us forward.</p></li><li><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>&nbsp;- All of us have a strong desire to grow. And fournova wants to help you achieve this. On the professional and on the personal, human level.</p></li><li><p><strong>REMOTE WORK</strong>&nbsp;- We are strong believers in freedom &amp; flexibility. Therefore, you can work from wherever you want. In order to keep in touch, however, we meet in person at least once every quarter: for our &quot;General Assemblies&quot; in Frankfurt or Berlin, and for our great team retreats in places like Corsica or Barcelona.</p></li></ul><p>Is this a culture that resonates with you? Can you contribute something to make fournova even better? Yes and yes? Then please get in touch with us!</p>"

What’s more important to us is that you have some experience dealing with (or working in) large-ish companies, you are great at managing relationships, and that you have a bit of a flair for producing written content.<br /><br />*What we do:* <br />It seems quite grand but we really do transform the way that business people work, learn and grow as professionals, with Looop’s innovative Digital Learning Platform and methodology. And we do this working with some of the most progressive and well-known companies in the world. <br /><br />*Who we are:*<br />Looop is a post-revenue, high-growth technology start-up, which means (in real language) we've done the really hard bit, turning a great idea into a business, and now we're growing the team to build on our initial success!<br /><br />Since 2014, we've been challenging the Learning & Development (L&D) industry to catch up with the way that technology enhances our daily lives: to ditch rubbish e-learning and keep out of the training room! By doing this, L&D can help everybody be better at their jobs and take on exciting new roles.<br /><br />Our customers are not just companies who pay us in exchange for tech. We build deep relationships with the brilliant people at ASOS, Amazon, Sky, Financial Times, and more, and they rely on us for thought-leading, practical support to get better results through their Learning & Development.<br /><br />As people, we are experts at what we do, driven to make a difference, and friends who like working with each other.

So, we're looking for somebody to join us who wants to:<br /><br />Help the brilliant and ambitious people, that we’re fortunate enough to call our customers, to do what they want to do with Looop… but better. You'll do this by responding to - and anticipating - their needs and staying close to them, leading them on their way, and providing expert, hands-on support;<br /><br />Help deliver consulting services to our customers following our proven (and improving) Looop methodology, which will include:<br /><br />* Helping them unpack business performance problems using the Looop methodology<br />* Designing and building resources<br />* Designing and leading campaigns for engagement<br />* Helping to quantify and report successful campaigns;<br />* Continuously improve Looop’s customer onboarding - and subsequent experiences - so their entire organisation benefits from what we know they can achieve with us.<br /><br />*Experience:*<br />We are really pushing our customers to think differently about their L&D and their business, and - in so doing - we’re helping them to improve. For this reason, we need somebody with at least some experience of working in a corporate environment. <br /><br />Developing ‘content’ is also a core element of this role, which will mean designing and building of learning resources as well as gaining high user-engagement, with the skills for this including writing, basic video production and running marketing campaigns.<br /><br />*You are:*<br />Real customer success comes from the heart.  You believe in what you do and are passionate about engaging people and driving positive change in business through the use of innovative technology. If this is you, we’d love you to speak with you!<br /><br />Many of the world’s most exciting and progressive companies are transforming their Learning & Development by adopting our technology and our approach, and we would love your help in taking care of them.<br /><br />*If you sound like the right person for this role then please apply below.*"
