This is a great opportunity to use your creative skills to create and edit content on a wide range of social media verticals for a leading entertainment website, which also happens to be in the top 50 in all internet websites in the United States. Don’t take our word for it, check it out at https://www.quantcast.com/ranker.com.</p><p>This is definitely not your everyday social media position, as we are focused on finding creative writer/editors who are basically culture junkies/ trivia nerds who know a LOT about a variety of relevant topics or are otherwise into obscure/ weird stuff at a deep level. For example, are you the gal or guy on your trivia team that everyone turns to when there’s a question about pop music? Do you listen to true crime podcasts and forget that you’re not supposed to talk about serial killers at house parties because it might make the wrong impression. If this sounds like you, this job might just be a good fit!</p><p><strong>Here are some examples of some of the Social Media verticals we create:</strong></p><p>Weird History: https://www.facebook.com/rankerweirdhistory<br>Total Nerd: https://www.facebook.com/rankertotalnerd/<br>Graveyard Shift: https://www.facebook.com/rankergraveyardshift/</p><p><strong>Want to be part of our Social Media team? Here’s how you’ll know if you’re going to love this job:</strong></p><p><strong>First, what’s in it for you:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll have the chance to express your creativity in front of a very large audience (think 100K to well over a million people) in a company that really lets you run with YOUR ideas.</li></ul><p><strong>Who we believe will do great in this role:</strong></p><p>Again, if you know a LOT about culture (think: urban legends, world history, books, games) and know how to write clean, snappy, intelligent, and compelling copy, you might be good fit for this role. In addition, we tend to focus on those candidates that have:</p><ul><li>EXCELLENT writing, editing, and communication skills. If you love to write, you’re going to do really well here.</li><li>Demonstrated social media savvy – we’re looking for people that can creatively reach out and engage an audience. Do you have your own web series or blog? We like that. Do you have a ton of Twitter followers? We like that too! Photoshop and graphic design chops are also a big plus, but not wholly necessary.</li><li>Viral intuition – Do you ever see something on Reddit and think, Hmm. That looks like something else I’ve seen before. Great impulse. We do that hourly. Recognizing patterns intuitively and knowing how to apply them is half the battle and spotting something trending and remembering that we have a piece of content that fits with it is huge.</li></ul><p><strong>If this sounds exciting, here’s what we need from you:</strong></p><ul><li>Since this isn’t a traditional job, just looking at your resume may or may not tell us much, and we would hate to ignore a good candidate who is perfect for this role but has been, for example, waiting tables or doing office admin. So feel free to send us anything about yourself to help prove to us that you have the right background – blog or social media posts, nerdy spreadsheets you keep for yourself, whatever. It doesn’t have to be fancy, we just need some sense of what you’re into and how deep you’re into it.</li><li>That said, provide a cover letter giving color/examples of how you meet and exceed the qualifications listed above. And yes, we are looking at your cover letter to get an idea of your writing style, so smart, funny letters really stand out.</li><li>Links to any social media properties you’ve helped program, particularly entertainment-focused channels. If you don’t have any social media programming experience, it’s not a dealbreaker for us, so don’t be afraid to apply anyway.</li><li>As we are a site with lists about literally everything, and we like editors who know lots about lots of things, it is also super helpful if you list in your cover letter any areas of expertise you have, from the broad to granular.</li></ul><p><strong>**SORRY, NO RECRUITERS**</strong></p><p><strong>About Ranker:</strong></p><p>Ranker is a data-driven media company, the #1 online destination for opinion-based, crowdsourced rankings of everything.

On the application form, you'll have the opportunity to specify your own topic specialties -- e.g., B2B / enterprise tech; B2C; cloud computing; big data; electronics / hardware; mobile; telecom; gaming; e-commerce; healthcare tech; ad tech; clean tech; and productivity / BPM.</p><p>We’re a small private agency, not an online freelance marketplace, so there’s no need for you to “bid” on gigs. Instead, writers who've been accepted to our network are contacted whenever we feel they’re right for a project. Payment is made on a per-project basis. Rates vary based on the type and length of the assignment.</p><p>(Kindly note: As a nascent service looking to build a diverse talent base, we have more writers than we do available work, but we will regularly keep you in mind for suitable projects.)</p><p>Writing samples are especially important. Feel free to submit any work that you’re proud of — whether it’s a batch of social media posts, a blog post or article, an outstanding essay or paper, or any other written work that demonstrates your skill.</p><p>On the application, you can express interest in one or more industries. You can also indicate the content types you believe you're best suited to write (e.g., social media posts, blog posts, listicles, etc.).</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Information Technology, Writing, Content Marketing, Content Creation, Content Writing, Technical Writing</div><div>Compensation</div><div>$0K–$10K<br>No Equity</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Not available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Prose Media</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/the-great-next/jobs/167924-freelance-content-writer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/the-great-next/jobs/167924-freelance-content-writer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Freelance Content Writer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/the-great-next/jobs/167924-freelance-content-writer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>The Great Next</a></div><div>Mumbai</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/vyve/jobs/328807-copywriter?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/vyve/jobs/328807-copywriter?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Copywriter</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/vyve/jobs/328807-copywriter?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Vyve</a></div><div>New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/studysoup/jobs/163745-writer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/studysoup/jobs/163745-writer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Writer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/studysoup/jobs/163745-writer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>StudySoup</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/l-t-co-1/jobs/126455-staff-writer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/l-t-co-1/jobs/126455-staff-writer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Staff Writer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/l-t-co-1/jobs/126455-staff-writer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>L&amp;T Co.</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/ihb-1/jobs/66553-content-writer-journalist-producer-reporter?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/ihb-1/jobs/66553-content-writer-journalist-producer-reporter?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Content Writer / Journalist / Pr...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/ihb-1/jobs/66553-content-writer-journalist-producer-reporter?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>BlockStreet</a></div><div>Bengaluru</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/inbody-usa-1/jobs/174691-freelance-blogger-for-health-wellness-medical-company?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/inbody-usa-1/jobs/174691-freelance-blogger-for-health-wellness-medical-company?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Freelance Blogger for Health &amp;

    "content": "<h2>Backpacking Freelance Writer &amp; Gear Tester</h2><div>Company: 99Boulders</div>Location: USA<br>Job Type: Contract<div>  <h4>Description</h4>  <div>                    <p>Hey there, Alex from 99Boulders here. I’m looking for a backpacking freelance writer and gear tester to, well, test backpacking gear and then write articles about it.</p><p>If you’re someone who goes on lots of backpacking trips then this gig is perfect for you. You’ll get free gear (you get to keep your favorite piece from each assignment) and you can profit from the backpacking trips you’re already taking because I'll pay you a flat fee to test the gear.</p><p>Here are all the juicy details:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Test backpacking gear</strong>&nbsp;by taking it with you on your backpacking trips and also when necessary by designing and conducting side-by-side tests at home to compare various features</li><li><strong>Take photos of the gear and your testing processes</strong>&nbsp;to include in your articles. Smartphone photos are fine.</li><li><strong>Write articles and reviews of the gear based on your testing.</strong>&nbsp;The most common type of article you’ll write will be ‘best of’ articles ranking and reviewing the top options you’ve tested (<a href='https://www.99boulders.com/best-battery-packs-for-camping-and-backpacking' rel='nofollow'>Example</a>). I will occasionally also assign you articles on other topics related to backpacking and backpacking gear.</li><li><strong>Ship gear back to me when you’re done with it (occasionally).</strong>&nbsp;Each assignment will include multiple pieces of gear. You keep your favorite and ship back the rest. This occurs infrequently because I’m fine with you batching shipments. For example, our climbing gear tester has been working for the site for almost a year and has only had to ship gear back to me two or three times.</li><li><strong>Pick up gear from the nearest Amazon Locker (occasionally).</strong>&nbsp;Shipping you gear presents a minor problem: the package might be stolen from your doorstep. This has happened to us once before. If I am worried that an expensive piece of gear could be stolen I might choose to ship it to the Amazon Locker nearest to you for you to pick up.</li><li><strong>Conduct research and interview experts (occasionally).</strong>&nbsp;In order to be able to write some articles you might have to conduct internet research and/or interview experts via phone or email.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Free gear</strong>&nbsp;– you get to keep your favorite piece of gear from each assignment</li><li><strong>Quality articles for your portfolio</strong>&nbsp;– one of our former writers included her 99Boulders articles in her portfolio and successfully pitched Backpacker magazine. Another writer had one of his 99Boulders articles republished on rockandice.com, a top climbing site.</li><li><strong>Ongoing and consistent assignments in a contract position</strong>&nbsp;– as long as you keep doing good work I'll keep having assignments for you. Seasonality and your own ability to get out in the field to test gear will affect frequency of assignments, but I’ll work with you to make the most of months where you don’t have any trips planned. I’m also highly flexible and am happy to schedule assignments so that they best fit your schedule.</li><li><strong>Competitive pay and compensation for testing</strong>&nbsp;– I offer a competitive per-word rate for articles and pay a flat fee for the testing portion of each assignment. You also get to invoice me for shipping costs so there's no cost to you to ship me back the gear.</li><li><b>Ability to work remotely on your own time</b></li><li><strong>Ability to pitch me your own article ideas</strong></li><li><strong>Consideration for related assignments and positions</strong>&nbsp;– if you do a good job testing backpacking gear you’ll be among the first considered for any future positions that may open up and any future assignments involving other types of outdoor gear, such as outdoor clothing and footwear</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Living in US</strong></li><li><strong>Fluent in English</strong></li><li><strong>3+ years backpacking experience</strong></li><li><strong>Freelance writing experience</strong></li><li><strong>You must be the type of backpacker who goes on lots of backpacking trips.</strong>&nbsp;If you aren’t, you won’t have enough chances to adequately test the gear at a decent rate, and I won’t be able to assign you many assignments.</li></ul><p>Bonus points if you have any of the following:</p><ul><li>Professional or exceptional backpacking experience (e.g. thru-hiked the AT, worked as a NOLS instructor)</li><li>Some photography chops</li></ul><p>NOTE: Your testing will mainly focus on lightweight and ultralight backpacking gear. If you’re the type of backpacker who isn’t much concerned with weight then your gear preferences won’t align well with those of your readers and as a result you won’t be a good fit for the position.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>INTERESTED? LET'S TALK NEXT STEPS</strong></p><ol><li>Apply via the link below</li><li>If I like your application I’ll reach out to you to discuss payment rates</li><li>Once we agree on payment I’ll move you on to a paid trial which will consist of 1-2 trial assignments</li><li>If you do a good job on the trial assignments we’ll have a brief phone interview</li><li>If I decide to hire you I will ask you to sign a contract and fill out a W-9</li></ol>          </div>          </div>"
